Throughout the Second World War, there were annual sports events at the <b>Army 
Technical School</b>, <b>Arborfield C. E. School</b> and the <b>Royal Merchant 
Navy School</b> in the north of the parish. For those who are interested, our 
<b>Data C.D.</b> can point you to dates of newspaper articles giving detailed lists of 
prize-winners. 
<p>However, there was no mention of regular sports fixtures until January 16th 
1943, when the following photo was published in the 'Reading Mercury':</p>

<p><b>'Arborfield Juniors football team'</b> (copyright 'Reading Mercury; used 
by permission). Unfortunately, due to lack of space, the newspaper didn't have 
an accompanying article naming the players. We can identify at least two of them 
- if you think you know who's in the photo, please let us know.</p>
<p>For the <b>1944-45 season</b>, a regular correspondent chronicled the many 
successes of the Arborfield Rangers football team:</p>
<font size="2">
<p>October 7th 1944: <b>Arborfield:</b> <b>Football:</b> In their first match of 
the season on Saturday, Arborfield Rangers drew with Havelock Rovers by 5-5. 
Goal scorers for Arborfield were <b>Nicholls </b>(3) and <b>Clark</b> (2). 
Fixtures are wanted by the secretary, <b>M. L. Barker, 28, Council-Houses, 
Arborfield</b>.</p>
<p>October 21st: <b>Arborfield:</b> <b>Football</b>: In their match on Saturday, 
Arborfield Rangers defeated Wokingham Juniors 2-1. <b>J. Nicholls</b> scored 
both goals for Arborfield.</p>
<p>November 11th: <b>Arborfield:</b> <b>Football:</b> Although Arborfield 
Rangers had scored two goals to nil in the first ten minutes of their game 
against a <b>R.E.M.E.</b> team on Saturday last, they finally lost 7-4. This was 
their first defeat of the season. <b>Whitfield</b>, <b>Heath</b>, <b>Barker</b>

<p>Three more matches in December 1944 resulted in wins of 9-0, 10-6 and 6-2. 
They even played on Christmas Day, against Bearwood Youth Club, winning 14-6.

newspaper there were news items on the <b>White Christmas</b> in Berkshire.</p>

  <p>During 1945, former members of the <b>Home Guard</b> formed the <b>

  scored several successes during that year.</p>
