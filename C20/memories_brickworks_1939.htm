<p>From the 'Times and Weekly News' of May 12th 1939:</p>
<font size="3"><b>
<p align="center">Disagreement over Petrol Station</p>
<p align="center">Appeal Against Wokingham R.D.C. Decision</p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>The desirability of building a petrol station and a shop at Arborfield was 
disputed at a local Inquiry held at the Board Room, Wokingham, on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Mr. E. Fitzgibbon, A.M.Inst.C.E., and Inspector of the Ministry of Health who 
also heard the proceedings for the Ministry of Transport, presided over the 
inquiry which was relative to an application of <b>
<a href="../properties_Brickworks.htm">Messrs. O. and A. Barker of Whitehall 
Brickworks, Arborfield</a></b>, for consent to the erection of <b>35 houses</b> 
and the establishment of a <b>general business area including a petrol filling 
station</b> on land fronting Reading – Eversley Road at Arborfield.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Bowyer, chartered Surveyor of Messrs. Edward and Charles Bowyer, 
of Reading, Slough and Bracknell, represented Messrs. Barker and he said that 
the council now had no objections to the residential layout and the main issue 
was whether or not the petrol station and a shop could be built. It was 
proposed, said Mr. Bowyer, to build these on either side of the entrance to the 
estate road; they would be designed so that they would be of similar appearance.</p>
<p>The council had refused the petrol pump on four grounds. First, that it was 
proposed to zone the land as residential. Again, site proposed for the petrol 
station was not good and the erection of such a building would injure the 
amenities and be a detriment to the locality. The council also, was endeavouring 
to regulate the distance between filling stations and it was believed that the 
proposals of Messrs. Barker were inappropriate and would have a detrimental 
effect on the amenities and on the traffic.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowyer went on to state his client’s case, saying that although this area 
was tentatively zoned as residential, there was a definite need for a shop at 
this point which was almost directly opposite one of the entrances to the War 
Department Barracks. The shop at this point [would] serve the Barracks 
particularly, but would be for the convenience of the existing residents. The 
demand for business premises had increased and this was a very convenient site 
for the shop. The petrol station, he thought, was not too near others in the 
district. The site was on the main <b>Aldershot to Reading Road</b> and the 
nearest filling station was at <b>Arborfield Cross</b> and consisted of one 
pump. There was a filling station at <b>Shinfield</b>, 2 miles away; at <b>
Eversley Bridge</b>, 2 miles in the other direction.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowyer emphasised the fact that no planning in this area could be final. 
With regard to the <b>Ribbon Development Act</b>, he commented on the County 
Council’s proposal to <b>widen the Reading – Eversley Road to 80 feet with cycle 
tracks</b>, and though that this proposal supported his client’s claim that a 
petrol station would be an advantage. There seemed, however, to be no objections 
on traffic grounds, only on planning. He explained that Messrs. O. and A. Barker 
were brickmakers and that the petrol station would be built by them and run by 
them or on their behalf.</p>
<p>Mr. Geoffrey Heath, Deputy Clerk to the Rural District Council who acted for 
the Council pointed out, when questioning Mr. Bowyer, that there were to be two 
new petrol pumps added to the filling station at Arborfield Cross. He asked if 
Mr. Bowyer were not more interested in the filling station and the shop than in 
the proposed houses, to which Mr. Bowyer replied that there could be no houses 
until there was an entrance to the estate road. He objected to Mr. Heath’s 
suggestion that if the petrol station and the shop were built the housing scheme 
would be dropped. The frontage, he said, had been purchased although it was 
known that it was tentatively zoned as a residential area.</p>
<p>Mr. Heath asked what demand there had been for houses and shops, to which Mr. 
Bowyer replied that application for business premises had been made by his 
clients Messrs. Barker. Mr. Heath suggested that before asking the council to 
re-zone the land for business purposes Mr. Bowyer must have strong grounds. What 
were they? He gave the development on that site in the last five years at 2 
houses. He suggested that the whole proposal was pure speculation on the 
supposition that the War Department Depot would increase business. Sound Town 
Planning, he said, made the grouping of shops necessary. Mr. Bowyer did not 
agree that this applied to rural areas.</p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>The Old and The New</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>"Is one shop in a residential area good planning?" asked Mr. Heath. "I think 
there is nothing more delightful than an English village made before the 
Planning Act was even thought of" said Mr. Bowyer. </p>
<p>Mr. E. R. Davies who represented the County Council, asked if it were 
necessary to have a petrol station at the entrance to a cul-de-sac. Mr. Bowyer 
thought that in this case, where the entrance was on a busy main road, it was. 
Mr. Davies asked if the houses would sell better if there was a petrol station 
at the end of the road. He asked who was going to live in the houses and learned 
that some of Messrs. Barkers’ employees would be the occupants.</p>
<p>Mr. M. F. J. Batting of Messrs. Simmons and Son, of Reading, who appeared on 
behalf of the adjoining owners, <b>Mr. Gerald Simonds</b> and <b>Mr. Vivian 
Simonds</b>, said that the adjoining land was zoned as an open space subject to
<b>6 houses</b>. His client then wished to preserve the amenities of the 
district. Now a <b>corrugated iron town had spread up</b> around and his clients 
thought that they could not keep to their agreement and they had <b>no objection 
to the proposed building</b>. The amenities could not be any worse than they 
were at present, he said. </p>
<p>Mr. Heath, cross questioning, said that the military huts were only temporary 
to which Mr. Batting replied that War Department land was rarely given back and 
the huts would be there for many years. </p>
<p>Mr. Heath explained that the site in question was about a mile from 
Arborfield Cross, which was generally recognised as the centre of the old 
village. The land was tentatively zoned as residential at <b>2 houses to the 
acre</b> and was isolated from concentrated development. It was the council’s 
intention, said Mr. Heath, to prevent development spreading away from the 
village and the erection of a shop as proposed was contrary to the council’s 
Town Planning Scheme. The petrol station too, would injure the amenities. There 
was very little demand, he said, for a Petrol Station, a shop, or indeed, for 
houses. In the last five years development all around that area had been very 
slow and only fifteen houses had been built, two of which were on the site under 
consideration. He submitted that the proposal was based entirely on speculation. 
The War Department, he said, would have no use for the shop, for shops would be 
provided on their own premises.</p>
<p>Mr. P. W. Meekle, chief assistant in the County Town Planning Department, 
said that the site was not suitable for a business area as it was isolated. 
Development, he thought, should be directed towards <b>Langley Common</b> from 
which the War Office land could be much better served. There was already 
business development there. He knew of no demand for a petrol station or for 
shops on the site in question. Mr. Davies said that the Council supported the 
Town Planning Authority. The proposal. he thought, cut across well planned 
developments. </p>

<p>The 'Mercury' of 1st July announced the Minister's decision on the Appeal, 
quoting from a letter received from the Ministry of Transport:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><i><span lang="EN-GB">"The Minister 
        has carefully considered the report of the officer <br>appointed to hold the 
        inquiry, and has consulted with the Minister of Health, <br>with whom he is 
        in agreement that the erection of a petrol filling station and shop <br>at 
        the entrance to a proposed estate road <br>in an area which is to be zoned 
        for residential purposes, <br>would be injurious to the amenities of the 
        locality, <br>and would not constitute well-planned development. <br><br>In the 
        circumstances, the Minister has reached the conclusion <br>that the 
        council’s decision to refuse consent to the development of the land <br>and 
        to the construction of means of access as now proposed was not 
        reasonable, <br>and accordingly has decided to make no order in the matter."</span></i></p>

<p>In the event, the outbreak of war only two months later put civilian 
developments on hold for many years.&nbsp; </p>
