<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><br>The 'Reading Mercury' announced the 
resignation of <b>James Hayward </b>as Headmaster of the School as 
follows on March 19th 1921:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"The managers of the <b>Arborfield and Barkham School</b> 
have appointed <b>Mr. W. J. Venable</b> [sic], of Brimpton, to succeed <b>Mr. J. 
H. Hayward</b> as head master. Mr. Hayward, who has held the mastership since 
1903, has resigned, having obtained an appointment under the London County 
Council."</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The <span lang="en-gb">May 7th edition recorded a 
presentation made at the School just over a week earlier:</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Arborfield and Barkham: Presentation to Head 
Master</font></b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Hayward</b>, who has been the head master of the Arborfield and 
Barkham School for nineteen years, and whose resignation has already been 
announced, left last week, and before his departure he was the recipient of 
several presents from his many friends in the two parishes. On Tuesday, April 26<sup>th</sup>, 
the parishioners of Arborfield presented him and Mrs. Hayward with a handsome 
clock. On Wednesday the Women’s Institute arranged a reception and dance, and on 
Thursday afternoon, April 28<sup>th</sup>, the managers, teachers and scholars 
gave him a handsome and useful suit case. The presentation took place at the 
school at the close of the afternoon school. <b>Mr. John Simonds</b>, chairman 
of the managers, presented, and there were present the <b>Rev. J. A. Anderson</b> 
and <b>Mrs. Anderson</b>, the <b>Rev. P. H. Ditchfield</b>, correspondent of the 
school, <b>Miss A. Simonds</b>, etc. </p>
<p>Mr. Simonds spoke of the service which Mr. Hayward had rendered for so long. 
The speaker said that he had lived in Arborfield all his life, and remembered 
the school being built in 1871, before which time there were two small schools 
in the two villages. He remembered the old master of the Arborfield school 
marching the children to church with a stout walking stick in one hand and a 
little cane in the other. When the new school was built <b>Mr. Austin</b> was 
appointed, <b>Mr. Webster</b> succeeding in 1878; he ruled till his death in 
1902 [aged 48; he was buried on April 19<sup>th</sup>], when Mr. Hayward, who 
had acted as Master ever since, was appointed. He had done good work for the 
school, and had earned the friendship and goodwill of his neighbours and the 
affection of the children, and they were all very sorry to lose him. They wished 
him every success in his new appointment. </p>
<p>The <b>Rector of Barkham</b> said it was a really sad day and he did not like 
partings, especially with one who for 19 years had lived amongst them, and to 
whom the children owed so much for their education. Nineteen years was a long 
time, the best part of a man’s life. The post of a schoolmaster was a very 
responsible one. They were fortunate in having a church school, wherein children 
were taught not only the "three R’s", but religion also, and how they might grow 
up to be good young men and women, and he was sure the children would be 
grateful to Mr. Hayward for all the care he had bestowed upon them. As 
correspondent of the school he had been greatly helped by Mr. Hayward, who was 
an excellent man of business and always faced difficulties with good humour and 
cheerfulness. Both the managers and teachers and the scholars all wished him 
much happiness and success in his new post under the <b>London County Council 
Education Committee</b>. They could not allow him to leave without some little 
present of his happy time in the Arborfield and Barkham School.</p>
<p>The presentation was then made by <b>Mrs. Edwards</b>, and <b>Miss Taylor</b>, 
who for many years had served on the staff of the school.</p>
<p>Mr. Hayward then replied, thanking all who had contributed to the present, 
and giving a touching farewell to the children, many of whom evidently felt his 
departure very much and were moved to tears.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. A. Anderson gave a stirring address to the children, and 
expressed their thoughts on parting with their kind teacher, and their good 
wishes for the future. The chairman then called on the children to give three 
cheers for Mr. and Mrs. Hayward, and the meeting terminated.</p>
<p><b><a href="families_Verrall.htm">Mr. Verrall</a></b>, of Brimpton School, 
has been appointed Mr. Hayward’s successor, and he will begin his work at the 
close of the Whitsun holidays. </p>
