<p>Arborfield Garrison was a tempting place for theft, judging from those 'up 
before the Court' during WWII, as these news items reveal. The 'Times and Weekly 
News' almost always referred to thefts as 'Larceny'. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The first case of the war was not at the 
Garrison, but at <b>Arborfield Grange</b>, as reported on 22nd September in an 
article entitled: </span><font size="2"><b><a href="families_Williamson.htm">

<p class="MsoNormal">On November 4th, the 'Mercury' related <font size="2">the 
case of Edward W. Holland, a carpenter of Stokenchurch, charged with stealing 
wire worth 1/- from huts under erection, under the heading: <b>"Stole Wire from 
Huts at Arborfield."</b> He was dealt with very leniently. Since the cost of 
reinstating the wires was 30 shillings, the case was dismissed on condition that 
the 30/- costs were paid by the defendant.</font></p>

Army cook, <b>Archibald Cook</b>, was bound over for three years by the 
Wokingham County Bench on Tuesday. On a charge of receiving the stolen property 
was <b>George Howes Bromley</b>, a pig dealer, of Arborfield, who was sentenced 
to three months’ imprisonment with hard labour. [The article went on to state 
that Bromley was licensed to collect swill from the camp, and described in 
detail what happened].</p>

County Police Court on Tuesday, when <b>Patrick William Moore</b>, of 
Arborfield, was charged with the theft of one pound of steak from an Army camp. 
Moore, the holder of the Military Medal, was sent to prison with hard labour for 
6 months. […] Moore, who had served throughout the last war and for a part of

<p>For being in possession of Government property, <b>Vincent N. Hemmy</b>, of

<p><b>Quarter Master Sgt. Frederick Turner</b> identified the property, which 
included tables, clothing, electric light bulbs, and other articles, as 
belonging to the War Department. The total value was £13 9s. 0d. – no civilian 
was allowed to have them in his possession.</p>
<p>Prosecuting, <b>Mr. E. P. Fullbrook</b>, said that the articles were found by

for two years in W.D. employ. </p>
<p><b>Mr. Piercy</b>, defending, said that some of the property had been 
abandoned, and Hemmy had scrounged the rest and gradually collected it. 
Defendant had no previous convictions. <b>Col. Barker</b> said that he thought 
defendant ought to go to prison, but the majority of the Bench were in favour of 
a fine.</p>

motor car on the Twyford By-Pass Road. Mr. Crocker explained that he did his
