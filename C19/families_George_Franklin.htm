<p class="MsoNormal">Back in 1929, the following gravestone was noted by <b>Mr.

churchyard:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img border="0" alt="Wording on George Franklin's gravestone" src  ="../images/new/Geo_Franklin.jpg" width=640 height=751 ></p>

a news article in the 'Reading Mercury' of September 11th 1869 relating what had 
happened a week before on September 4th:</span></p>

<font size="4">
<p align="center"><b>SAD AND FATAL ACCIDENT </b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>Considerable excitement was occasioned on Saturday evening, by the report 
that a young man, named <b>George Franklin</b>, in the employ of <b>Messrs. 
Righton and Son</b>, butchers, <b>Broad-street</b>, had been thrown from a cart 
and killed. Unfortunately the news proved to be correct. </p>
<p>It appears that the deceased was proceeding down <b>Sulham Hill</b>, when 
from some cause or other, which will ever remain a mystery, he was thrown from 
his seat and sustained fatal injuries. No one except a girl, of the age of 13 
years, witnessed the accident, and therefore the evidence as to how the deceased 
was thrown from the cart is involved in uncertainty.</p>
<p>He had been in the employ of Messrs. Righton for two years, and was a 
respectable, steady man. On Monday an inquest was held on the body, before <b>W. 
Weedon, Esq.</b>, coroner, and a respectable jury, of whom <b>Mr. James Duckett</b> 
was foreman. </p>
<p>After viewing the body the following evidence was adduced:- </p>
<p><b>Hannah Hunter</b> said – I am the wife of <b>Matthias Hunter</b>, 
labourer. At about 8.40 p.m., on Saturday, my little girl told me she thought 
something the matter in the road, as she saw something white lying down, and 
heard a noise, and saw a horse’s tail frisking. The child is twelve years of 
age, and is unwell this morning. I went to the spot. It was at the foot of 
Sulham Hill. I found a horse on the ground, and a man under it. The horse was 
attached to a cart, and the cart was lying on its side. I sent my little girl 
for my husband. He came, and with the assistance of another man, the body of the 
deceased was raised up and removed to the <b>school-room</b>. I thought that the 
deceased was quite dead at the time. I saw no-one with the cart, and I did not 
notice if there was any name on the cart. </p>
<p>There was meat in it – <b>Matthias Hunter</b>, labourer, said – I am the 
husband of the last witness. I was called to the deceased, so ascribed by her, 
and found the deceased man in the position mentioned. I and another man got him 
from under the horse and took him to the School-room. He was quite dead. I did 
not know the deceased, but I have seen him several times driving the same cart, 
which belongs to Mr. Righton, butcher, Reading. Deceased did not always drive 
the same horse. I am not sure whether I saw this horse before. The front part of 
the cart was broken, as if it had been kicked; he looked as if the horse had 
fallen on him, and he had not moved. The kicking strip was broken, and the rest 
of the harness was sound. The horse appeared too little for the cart. The horse 
was coming down the hill. I have not heard of any one who saw the accident. A 
brother and sister of the deceased came to see the body yesterday. They 
recognised it as that of their brother. They said his age was 23 years age, next 
birthday. I did not hear his name. </p>
<p>By the <b>Foreman</b>. – I saw the wheel mark on the back. The cart was in 
the road, lying on the off side wheel. </p>
<p><b>Police-constable Herring</b> said – I saw the brother and sister of the 
deceased yesterday. They recognised the body as that of their brother. They said 
his name was George Franklin; that he worked for Mr. Righton, and was 22 years 
of age. They also identified the watch I found on the body. I did not see the 
body until it was in the school-room. I have inquired but cannot hear of anyone 
who saw the accident. </p>
<p><b>Henry Ireland</b> said. – I am in Mr. Righton’s employ. Deceased had been 
in Mr. Righton’s service about two years. I had never been out with the horse 
deceased was with. My master had had it a fortnight. I don’t know whether it was 
steady or not. I had not heard of any accident with it before. There was no one 
with the deceased when he started from the shop, at about ten o’clock on 
Saturday morning. The horse started quickly. </p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of "Accidental Death".</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sulham Hill</b> is to the west of <b>Tilehurst</b>, and 
at the bottom of the hill is a junction with <b>Little Heath Road</b> at <b>

shown in the bottom left of&nbsp;the 6-inch Ordnance Survey map from 1881:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="4">George Franklin's family</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the 1861 Census, <b>George and Ann Franklin</b> were 
living in Arborfield somewhere near the 'Bramshill Hunt' P. H., along with their 
younger children <b>Ann</b>, <b>Charlotte</b>, <b>Charles</b>, <b>Ellen</b> and
<b>John</b>. It appears that their eldest son <b>George</b>, then aged about 14, 
had already left the household by this time. His father, an agricultural 
labourer, had been born in Swallowfield, while his mother, a charwoman, was from 
Reading St. Laurence. All of the children living with them were born in Barkham.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">George senior died in 1864 aged only 39, and is buried at 
Arborfield. His widow Ann married <b>George Dash</b> of Hazeley Heath in the 
December quarter 1867 in the Wokingham area; he was at least 10 years her 
junior. By 1871 George and Ann Dash were living in Arborfield along with Ann's 
children <b>Ann</b>, <b>Charlotte</b>, <b>John</b> and 9-year-old <b>William</b>.&nbsp;
<b>Ellen</b> had left the household to work as a nursemaid and domestic servant 
for the Curate of Arborfield, <b>Wyndham C. Hill D'Aeth</b>., who lived at 
Arborfield Cross. Wyndham had married <b><a href="../families_simonds.htm">Mary 
Simonds</a></b> of Newlands, and by this time, they had three small children: <b>
Harriet</b>, <b>Wyndham</b> and <b>Cloudsley</b>. Ellen's brother <b>Charles</b> 
had left the parish; in 1875 he married <b>Amelia Vickers</b>, and although they 
made their home in Reading, they brought their children <b>Ellen</b> and <b>
Charles</b> to be baptised at Arborfield in 1878 and 1879.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1881, the <b>Dash</b> family were still living in 
Arborfield, near to Targett's Farm. Ellen Franklin had returned to live there 
with her brother William and sister Ann, then aged 31; both sisters were 
seamstresses. By 1888, Ann had died aged only 39, and is buried alongside her 
brother. In 1929, Mr. Chambers found '<font size="2">a small wooden cross that 
is all perished but there is a glass case with a card inside which has on it: "<b>Ann Franklin</b>, who died March 6 88 aged 39 
      years". Her mother died in 1899 aged 75, while her step-father George Dash 
died in 1898, aged 62. By 1929, the Dash's grave wasn't even marked with a 
wooden cross.</font></p>
