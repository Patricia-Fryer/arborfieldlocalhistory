        <p class="stbody">Two months after the fatal air crash in the village in 
        late July 1931, there was another forced landing in <b>Arborfield</b>, but we 
        don't have any clues where. As reported in the '<b>Reading Mercury</b>', 
        the plane took off again successfully but crashed a few miles away in 
        <b>Bracknell</b> (which itself was not much more than a village in the early 
        1930's). This looks like another Gipsy Moth biplane.</p>

        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">An aeroplane crashed into a tree at 
        Bracknell on Saturday evening, and remained there, but the two occupants 
        were not hurt and managed to reach the ground by sliding down one of the 
        wings and dropping the remaining six feet.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The machine, which belonged to <b>
        Messrs. Phillips and Powis, at Woodley Aerodrome</b>, had left Woodley 
        in the afternoon, piloted by <b>Mr. Glen Richardson</b>, a student, 
        whose home is in Glamorganshire, and who had just learnt to fly. He was 
        alone in the machine and lost his way.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">He came down at <b>Arborfield</b> 
        and telephoned to the aerodrome, from which <b>Commander C. W. Croxford</b>, 
        one of the instructors, went to assist him. Commander Croxford flew the 
        machine with Mr. Richardson as passenger, but he took the wrong 
        direction, eventually a landing was made in a field near <b>Broad Lane, 
        Bracknell</b>. It was in taking off again that the machine struck a 
        tree.</span></p>

        <p class="stbody">Believe it or not, this aircraft was repaired and flew 
        for several more years. Thanks to Richard Riding, of the <b>
        <a href="http://dhmothclub.co.uk/">DH Moth Club</a></b>, we have a photograph 
        from 1937, taken by his father:</p>

        <p class="stbody">Richard says:&nbsp; G-EBZL, built at Stag 
          Lane in 1928, was first owned by G.R. Boyd Carpenter and based at Kano 
          in Nigeria until returned to the UK in 1930. From August 1935 the Moth 
          was owned by the Yapton Aero Club at Ford. During the war the Moth was 
          impressed into RAF service and was scrapped at RAF Halton in April 
          1944. Moths were crashing all over the countryside but were invariably 
          repaired and soon back in the air - to be crashed again!</p>
