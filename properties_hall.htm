        The Hall had been in existence for several hundred 
        years in some form or other until the 1960's when it was demolished. 
        Berkshire Record Office has a Manor and Estate Map from 1810 when the 
        Hall was owned by <b>George Dawson</b>, and the Local History Society has 
        transcribed the 'terrier' (list of land holdings).</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_Mitford">Mary Mitford</a></b>, in her book 'Our Village', called the Hall 'Aberleigh', 
        and hence Reading University gave this name to the 1960's house that 
        replaced it. </p>

        <p class="stbody">Families who have owned it include: <b>
        <a href="families_bullock.htm">Bullock</a>,
        <a href="families_Standen.htm">Standen</a>, Dawson,
        <a href="families_conroy.htm">Conroy</a>,
        <a href="families_Hargreaves.htm">Hargreaves</a>, Allsebrook</b>. The 
        land was also owned by the <b>National Institute for Research in 
        Dairying (<a href="properties_NIRD.htm">NIRD</a>)</b>,&nbsp; but this 
        organisation is now re-absorbed into Reading University, who still carry 
        out agricultural research there.&nbsp; In the Conroy family's time, Hall 
        Farm was already renowned for its innovative agricultural practices, so 
        it makes an appropriate place for University research.</p>

        <p class="stbody">We now know what the original Tudor Manor house looked 
        like, because there are two sketches by <b>Emma Elizabeth Thoyts</b> 
        (1860-1949).&nbsp; Here they are:</p>

        <p class="stbody">There are several photos and 
        other images of the Victorian building that was itself in Tudor style,

        <p class="stbody">The Hall was occupied by both the <b>RAF</b> and the
        <b>American 
        forces</b> during the <b><a href="properties_hall_ww11.htm">Second World War</a></b>. Nissen Huts were put up on either 
        side of the track from Church Lane to the Hall, and after the War, 
        many families were housed in them until Anderson and Emblen Crescents 
        were completed. One family took up residence in a lodge of the Hall, as this 1946 article from the 
        'Times and Weekly News' (later known as the 'Wokingham Times') records:</p>

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><b><i>SQUATTERS AT ARBORFIELD HALL</i></b></p>

        <p class="stbody"><i><b><a name="Davis">Mrs H. Davis</a></b> is tasting the joys of a real home, 
        even though a borrowed one, after 10 years of married life. Although her 
        husband was demobbed from the R.A.F. some time ago, he has had to live 
        in separate "digs" from her and their two years old son, owing to the 
        housing shortage. They have, therefore, followed the lead of the 
        squatters and moved into the modern, comfortably equipped lodge in the 
        grounds of Arborfield Hall. At the time our representative called, Mrs 
        Davis was busily ironing in the cosy living room, with a bright coal 
        fire burning in the open hearth. Her small son was making good use of 
        the tiny garden to ride his tryke.</i></p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>Prior to the Davis family's installation at the lodge, the building had 
        been empty about nine months. Mrs Davis informed our reporter that she 
        had received a visit from the Surveyor of the Wokingham District 
        Council, who had promised to have the light and water facilities turned 
        on should further squatters arrive.</i></p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>In the meantime, Mrs Davis is quite happy cooking 
        by means of a primus stove and using oil lamps for lighting. Water has 
        at present to be carted half a mile.</i></p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>At the entrance to Arborfield Hall, which has been 
        used as an Army camp during the War, there is a large notice erected, 
        warning the public to keep out, as the camp is needed for further use.</i></p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>WOKINGHAM TIMES, September 1946.</i></p>

        <p class="stbody">By 1955, Arborfield Hall was derelict and was deemed 
        to be in too poor a condition to adapt for new uses. Its owner, the 
        University of Reading, demolished it soon after this photograph was 
        taken:</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The building that replaced 
        Arborfield Hall is known as 'Aberleigh'. It takes up only a fraction of the floor-space 
        of the Hall, 
        but there is still some evidence of the original building around the 
        garden, including steps down to the River Loddon. The old Rose Gardens 
        and other features are long since gone, but the old Boat-House still 
        remains.&nbsp; (Note: this is a private house, and the road that passes 
        it is a private road).</span></b></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The following photos 
        of 'Aberleigh', the steps, boathouse and Hall Farmhouse were taken during a Society 
        visit on 14th June 2004:</span></b></p>

        <p class="stbody">There is only pedestrian access from Church Lane, 
        Carters Hill and Shinfield. When the Ordnance Survey were assembling 
        Rights of Way, the University and the Parish Council fought over one 
        path - see <b><a href="properties_Hall_Footpath.htm">here</a></b>. A 
        hundred years before, some footpaths to the Old Church were eliminated 
        because they were no longer needed once the new Church had been 
        completed.</p>
