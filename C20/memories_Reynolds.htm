<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><br>Sometimes we receive welcome 
snippets of history by e-mail, and the following is a delightful example from 
Summer 2010. It has been edited slightly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">"I am e-mailing you on behalf of 
my mother <b>Mrs Elizabeth Reynolds née Applin</b>, who 
was married from <b><a href="../properties_hall.htm">Arborfield Hall</a></b> in 1951."</span></p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">In a later e-mail, Jacki Reynolds said: 
"Unfortunately, neither myself nor my mother live near Arborfield. Mom and her 
sister Rose originated from Aldershot, and Rose went on to live in Reading after 
her marriage, and mom spent most of her time there. When mom married, it was to 
a "Brummie" and she settled in Birmingham. I am not sure if she has any pictures 
of the Nissen Huts; she did have a picture of the cows in the river, a similar 
picture to the one in the gallery on your site but cannot find it at present."</span></p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">Needless to say, we would love to see 
photos of the <b>Nissen Huts</b> in the grounds of Arborfield Hall. They were 
temporary homes to dozens of families in the late 1940s and early 1950s.</span></p>

contributor, together with details of <b><a href="#wedding">Elizabeth's wedding</a></b> and <b>
<a href="#Legend">some local 
legends</a></b>: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">Her sister and brother-in-law 
<b>Bob and Rose&nbsp;Davis</b> (no relation to the <b>
<a href="../properties_hall.htm#Davis">Davis family</a></b> in your article)&nbsp;moved into 
a&nbsp;<b><a href="../properties_hall_squatters.htm">Nissen Hut</a></b>&nbsp;around 1949 and stayed there for 6 to 12 months before moving into 
the 1st floor flat in Arborfield Hall with their first three children <b>Patrick
</b>(Paddy), <b>Robin</b> (deceased) and <b>Kevin</b>; their fourth child <b>Sean</b> was born there in 1951. 
Paddy played quite frequently with <b><a href="../memories_esme.htm">Esme Hiscock</a></b>, the little girl in your article 
who had the tragic accident.</span></p>

Nissen Hut, with Arborfield Hall in the background]</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The flat took up the majority 
of the first floor with the exception of a few rooms that were in disrepair. 
There was a lounge, kitchen, bathroom, two large bedrooms and another 
smaller&nbsp;bedroom. Below them in the ground floor flat lived&nbsp;<b>Sammy and 
Bella&nbsp;Watton</b>. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The <b>
<a href="memories_LHD_Lorries.htm">Muir</a></b> family in your article 
owned the local dairy. They were guests at my parent’s <a name="wedding">wedding</a> and reception 
which took place at The <b>Magpie and Parrot</b> public house. Some of the main wedding 
party, including my mother and father, were given a lift back from the reception 
in the dairy van.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="en-gb">From the marriage certificate, 
we learn that the wedding took place at the Catholic Church of Christ the King 
in Cressingham Road, Reading, on 21st April 1951. Both Ronald Frederick Reynolds 
and Elizabeth Mary Applin were 24; he was a Scaffolder and she was a Stores 
Record Clerk. Both were living at the Arborfield Hall camp at the time. Ronald’s 
father Alfred Frederick Reynolds was a Foreman Stamper at an engraver’s, while 
Albert Ebenezer Applin was a Timekeeper for the Court Service. Elizabeth’s 
sister Rose Davis was one of the witnesses. The Registrar was the aptly-named 
William Joseph Church. </span></i></p>

<a href="../families_Hargreaves.htm">Hargreaves</a></b> family purchased the 
Arborfield Hall estate, 5 miles from the 
county town of Reading and 3 miles from the Hampshire border village of Eversley 
where Charles Kingsley, author of&nbsp; ‘The Water Babies’ is buried in the old 
parish church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">Running through their land was 
the <b>River Loddon</b>: beautiful in the summer, but prone to

Their house, Arborfield Hall, stood tall and imposing surrounded by a long 
semi-circular drive with a lodge house at each entrance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><b>Arborfield Hall </b>boasted a<a href="../pictures_collier_A793.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Arborfield Hall in around 1910" vspace   =5 align=right src="../images/Collier/TN/Collier_A793.jpg" width=252 height=175 ></a> 
magnificent ballroom with a high vaulted ceiling. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The entrance to the Hall was a wide 
white portico leading to a spacious hall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The eye was drawn to the wide sweeping 
staircase leading to the first floor; at the bend of the staircase there were 
two full length stained glass windows and in later years the names of all the 
previous owners were printed on each small section; these names could also be 
found in the old chapel. Sadly, these windows were replaced with plain glass 
over the years due to damage. Either side of the windows stood two full length 
mirrors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The staircase led up to a long 
picture gallery running almost the full length of the house. Rooms and 
passageways led off this gallery. To the far end, a grilled door led to a spiral 
staircase, which came up from the basement kitchen and in turn led to the 
servants’ quarters on the upper floor. This was still in place when the first 
floor was converted into the flat. This floor consisted of many, many rooms or 
cubicles which in turn led up to the turreted roof and bell tower.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The ballroom and several of the 
downstairs rooms led out to the paved courtyard and from there a big lawn sloped 
downwards towards the River Loddon, where a narrow path led right to the stables 
and to their own private chapel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" alt="The weir on the River Loddon, behind Arborfield Hall" src  ="../images/new/Weir_back_of_hall.jpg" width=613 height=438 ><span lang="en-gb"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">It passed the gardeners’ small building 
and arrived at a high walled opening, which led to the chapel. The wall was 
covered in purple wisteria and the bushes and shrubs had been allowed to grow 
over the path making it difficult at times to negotiate, especially when the 
weather turned wet and the path became very slippery.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The pathway to the left of the 
house was a tree lined winding path which veered away from the river and then 
returned to follow the water until it reached the main road and the chief 
bridge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">There are three bridges in all; 
two smaller bridges covering small tributaries of the Loddon.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

committed suicide by jumping off the main bridge and drowning in the flooded 
river.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The tragic circumstances of the butler’s death happened in the early 18<sup>th</sup> 
century, but more tragedy was to come that would alter the atmosphere of the 
‘big house’.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">Late into the 18<sup>th</sup> 
century, <b>a young serving maid</b>, wishing to marry her childhood sweetheart who 
lived in nearby Arborfield, sought permission from her employer, the then 
squire. It was the custom in those days for the servants to marry within the 
household staff. The servant was heartbroken when not only was permission denied 
but she was then informed that she was to marry a young footman. The marriage 
plans were brought forward to take place in their private chapel on the next 
Saturday. Devastated, the young maid got word to her former lover telling him 
that she could not marry him, and would never be able to see him again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">There was no way out for her as 
there was no work anywhere else; her family depended on her meagre wage, and her 
boyfriend could only get casual work on the farms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">Saturday came and she exchanged 
vows with this person whom she did not love or like. Her fellow servants could 
hardly hear her responses as tears spilled down her face onto her Sunday best 
dress.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The wedding over, the bride and 
groom began walking back; making their way along the narrow river path leading 
to the back of the house (the kitchens were underground and could only be 
entered by the steps of <b>the ‘area’ </b>as it was called). Suddenly, a dreadful high 
pitched scream rang out followed by shouting and cursing. The servants hurried 
to the scene. The ghastly spectacle that greeted them was the most terrifying, 
sickening disaster. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The body of the bride lay 
grotesquely dangling over a yellow gorse bush, by now stained with blood gushing 
from a gaping gash in her throat. The body of her lover laid half in and half 
out of the water with a knife protruding from his chest. The young bridegroom 
was crouched on the path babbling incoherently one minute and screaming the 
next. In the turmoil that followed one more person died of shock, and one more 
ended up in the ‘mad house’ as it was known in those days. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The legend goes that the 
bride’s body was placed before her burial in the gardener’s hut, which 
henceforth was always referred to as <b>Millie’s Morgue</b>. It is said that on each 
anniversary of her death she can be seen coming from the morgue and walking the 
path along the river bank. But she has also been seen by many people floating 
through the house.</span></p>
