        <br>
        Thomas Hodgson and the paper mills are first mentioned in the Arborfield 
        Rate Book in 1786, though there was already a fire insurance policy 
        dated 29th September 1795: Sun Fire Insurance Policy No. 509761: </p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>Thomas Hodgson at 425 in the Strand, Paper Maker

        Drying house communicating near brick timber and tiled £300. Utensils

        <p class="stbody">In 1786 the paper mill was insured by <b>Thomas 
        Hodgson</b> and <b>Richard Bloxam</b>, paper makers (S.F.I.P. 522631, 
        3rd October). This was an early instance of a partnership involving 
        stationers and a paper maker. It led to the present-day firm of Spalding 
        &amp; Hodge; in 1789 <b>Thomas Spalding</b> and <b>Henry Routh</b>, both 
        stationers of the Strand, went into partnership with Thomas Hodgson, 
        stationer, of the Strand and paper-maker of Arborfield, Berkshire. 
        (Coleman “The British Paper Industry”, quoting Spalding &amp; Hodge Ltd. 
        150th Anniversary Souvenir, 1789-1939).</p>

        <p class="stbody">Whilst the Paper Mill was in operation, there was also 
        a Corn Mill, as recorded in this advert in the Reading Mercury on 9th 
        June 1788:&nbsp; <i>Reading: “A new brick corn mill, at Arborfield, two 
        miles from Wokingham, two pairs of French and one pair of Cullens, 
        extensive store rooms. Situate on a most excellent stream of water of 
        vast improvement, and where a most profitable and certain business may 
        be carried on. To be entered under lease on Michaelmas next, 1788. 
        Enquire to <b>Mr. Smallbone</b>, Arborfield.” </i> </p>

        <p class="stbody">By 1794, the Paper Mill business had to be sold 
        because Thomas was in financial difficulties.<br>

        In 1862, Alfred Towgood was recorded as running Aborfield Mill, near

        Dried Rope Browns, Leather Boards in addition to Air Dried Browns. There 
        was now one paper machine 72in. and one board machine 48in. The raw

        <p class="sthead"><font size="4">A Lease - and a Dispute</font></p>

        <p class="stbody">In 1860 John Hargreaves (the 
        then owner of Arborfield Hall and estate) leased the mill to a 
        papermaker from Riversfield, near St. Neots in Huntingdon, Alfred 
        Towgood. The occupier of the Hall and their friends, companions and 
        servants were allowed to fish in the river except the part of the river 
        which ran between the mill and the end of the garden. However soon 
        afterwards there followed a serious dispute concerning this Lease. </p>

        <p class="stbody">Mr. John Hargreaves sought to restrain Alfred Towgood 
        from carrying out alterations to the mill. These included the 
        installation of two steam engines with the necessary 45 foot chimney and 
        coal store all of which Towgood had already carried out. It was felt 
        that these alterations “would entirely alter the nature of the said Mill 
        and Property and be a nuisance and annoyance to the occupier for the 
        time being of Arborfield Hall” Alfred Towgood insisted upon his alleged 
        right to make these alterations and additions in and to the Mill and 
        Property. </p>

        <p class="stbody">The dispute was unresolved and on the 18th September 
        1860 a Bill was filed against Alfred Towgood in the High Court of 
        Chancery. However, things must have been resolved by February 1861 as on 
        the 14th a “Deed of Arrangement” (for full text, click <b>
        <a href="#Deed_of_Arrangement">here</a></b>) was signed by all parties 
        in which Alfred Towgood was permitted to keep his alterations and be 
        responsible for maintaining them. He was prevented from increasing the 
        steam power any further and he needed written permission to make any 
        more alterations or additions. He was also to use Welsh coal or any 
        other smokeless Fuel so that the Chimney smoke would not be a nuisance 
        to the occupier of Arborfield Hall.</p>

        <p class="stbody">John Hargreaves requested his solicitor to draw up the 
        Deed of Arrangement. The 
        yearly rate was to be two hundred and ten pounds "clear of land tax and 
        all other taxes, rates and assessments except landlords property tax now 
        or hereafter to be imposed upon or in respect of the premises or any 
        part thereof." (see below for text).<br>
        <br>
        The terms of this lease stated that Towgood was only to use the mill as 
        a paper mill. He was to keep the grassland in a "husbandlike and proper 
        manner." The occupier of the Hall and their friends, companions and 
        servants were allowed to fish in the river except the part of the river 
        which ran between the mill and the end of the garden.</p>
