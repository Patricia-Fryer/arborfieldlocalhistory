        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">
        Over several years, there have been rumours that there was a <b>decoy 
        airfield during WWII</b> in the grounds of <b>Arborfield Hall</b>. At last, we now 
        have the facts. There wasn't an airfield, but there was a decoy site known 
        as a <b>‘Starfish’</b>. These decoy sites were so top-secret that they 
        remained classified for decades after 1945, so it’s no wonder that 
        stories are confused.  </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">
        A book written in 2000 entitled <b>‘Fields of 
        Deception’</b> tells the whole story about the decoys – and may jog some local memories. 
        If so, please let us know!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">
        The book gives scant detail about the <b><a href="#site">Arborfield</a></b> site 
        (<b>one of 
        three protecting Reading</b>), but it does have an aerial photograph clearly 
        showing where Arborfield’s was located, plus a second aerial photo of 
        another of the three sites, at Sulham.<a href="properties_starfish_site_closeup.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The main 'Starfish' site at Arborfield taken from an aerial photo of 8th March 1944" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Aerial/Starfish_Closeup_TN_R.jpg" width="225" height="600"></a></span></p>

        The idea of decoy airfields and other pieces of deception was tried out 
        with some success in the Great War, but the lessons were soon forgotten. 
        It wasn’t until the late 1930’s that something was done to repeat the 
        process. The film-maker <b>Alexander Korda</b> of Denham Studios was one 
        of the catalysts in planting the idea, but it was another film-maker, <b>
        Norman Loudon</b> and his <b>Sound City Films of Shepperton</b>, who 
        turned the idea into reality, or at least make-believe.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt" 
     >
        <b>Colonel John Turner</b> was the ideal person to mastermind the whole 
        scheme. After a distinguished career in the Army, he had worked as the 
        civilian Director of Works and Buildings at the Air Ministry in the 
        1930’s, setting up real airfields, and he retired just before WWII 
        started. He was head-hunted and agreed to lead the new secret departm</span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt" 
     >ent 
        back at the Air Ministry in the Strand. For some years, it didn’t even 
        have a name. Even at his death in 1958, his Obituary didn’t mention his 
        role. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt" 
     >
        Of course, the film industry was highly skilled at deception, and it was 
        able to turn out reasonable copies of Hurricane fighters and Wellington 
        and Whitley bombers which looked realistic from the air. It was able to 
        mimic the ‘satellite airfields’ that were set up close to the main 
        fighter and bomber airfields, and it created some highly-effective 
        special effects to deceive night-time flyers. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-WEIGHT: 700"><font size="4">What 
        kinds of Decoy were there?</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The first decoys were classed as <b>‘K’ – the 
        daytime dummy airfields</b>. They were initially successful in drawing 
        enemy fire away from the real airfields, but it was soon apparent that 
        they couldn’t fool the Luftwaffe for more than a year or so. They 
        required a lot of manpower to maintain the effect – by turning the dummy 
        aircraft through 90 degrees and moving them around the site to give the 
        impression of activity; by racing lorries along&nbsp; imaginary runways to 
        display the marks of &nbsp;take-offs and landings.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Far more effective were the <b>night-time decoys – 
        the ‘Q’ sites</b>. They had electric lights to mimic the glide-paths of 
        real airfields, and if a ‘friendly’ aircrew was deceived into attempting 
        a landing (which often happened), the lights had to be extinguished 
        quickly. By day there was little to see.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">There’s no evidence that the Arborfield site was 
        either a ‘K’ or a ‘Q’ at any time. <b>Warfield</b> (Grid reference SU 
        863744) was the nearest example of a ‘Q’ site.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">There were elaborations on the ‘Q’ theme to 
        represent <b>factories, railway marshalling yards</b> and <b>docks</b>, 
        and to mimic the effect of incendiary bombs with <b>fires</b>, but there 
        was no need for anything on this scale in Berkshire.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">By November 1940 there was a need for <b>‘SF’</b> 
        or <b>‘Special Fire’ </b>sites to draw bombers away from major towns and 
        cities. Eventually they became known as <b>‘Starfish’ </b>(from the 
        letters 'SF'), 
        and this is what was created in Arborfield. Each site would have a 
        variety of special effects primed by electric fuses, to be brought 
        into action as soon as a raid was anticipated. While the rest of the 
        countryside was blacked-out, tell-tale signs of light would appear at 
        the decoy sites, and as soon as incendiaries were being dropped, the 
        fires would start.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reading</b> was number 29 on the list of towns and 
        cities to get ‘Starfish’ protection, and its first site would have been 
        ready in early 1941:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SF29(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Binfield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SU 
        831732<br>
        SF29(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Arborfield&nbsp;&nbsp;SU 755687<br>
        SF29(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sulham&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SU 
        637736.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">We now know from the National Archives that both 
        the Binfield and Arborfield sites were operational until November 1944, 
        but Sulham was probably decommissioned before then. <a name="site">Here's the 
        Arborfield site</a> 
        in two shaded areas 
        super-imposed on a 1940's Ordnance Survey map. It is in two parts, the 
        northern one being the main operational area:</p>

        <img border="2" alt="The site of SF29(b) on Arborfield Hall Farm, next to the main track" src  ="images/Starfish.jpg" width=464 height=408 ></a></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The <b>
        <a href="properties_starfish_site_closeup.htm">aerial photo of Arborfield from 8<sup>th</sup> 
        March 1944</a></b> shows that there were many clusters of <b>‘Basket Fires’</b> 
        in the main operational area. These 
        were typically 3 ft. square wooden crates on legs, lined with wire netting and 
        filled with layers of highly flammable but cheap materials such as scrap 
        wood, shavings, sawdust and pine clippings, with a gallon of creosote 
        spread between each layer. Covered in netting and hessian and topped 
        with roofing felt, there would be dozens arranged in groups. When 
        ignited, they would look from the air 
        like houses on fire. Most would be ready to ignite electrically, but 
        adjacent ones would catch fire as the conflagration spread – aided by 
        ‘flare cans’ containing 4 gallons of creosote linked to the cages with 
        wicks. The effect would last well over an hour.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Three other main classes of fire were:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>‘Crib Fires’</b> – large cages with flare cans 
        underneath, with a layer of firewood and topped with coal, to give a 
        longer burn – up to 4 hours.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>‘Boiling Oil Fires’</b> – heavy steel troughs with half 
        a ton of coal mixed with creosoted waste, topped with steel trays. 
        Diesel or gas oil would be fed from one tank, while water would 
        intermittently be fed from another to give a varied pyrotechnic display.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>‘Grid Fires’</b> – a header tank of liquid fuel would 
        be sent down a sprinkler pipe to a grid of fire elements stretched over 
        about 12 yards, and producing a vivid yellow flame.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The site needed to be at least 800 yards from 
        settlements – and the one at Arborfield, almost exactly on the northern 
        part of the <b>Bernard Weitz dairy research centre</b> at Hall Farm, was well 
        away from both Arborfield Cross and the cluster of buildings around the 
        Hall, though quite close to Hall Farm house and Carter’s Hill Farmhouse.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Some Starfish sites were spectacularly successful; 
        those around Bristol and Portsmouth attracted many bombs and undoubtedly 
        saved these cities from greater destruction. Others were not so good, 
        for various reasons. We know 
        that Reading passed through the war relatively unscathed, so there may 
        not have been much need to fire its Starfish sites. If they were set 
        ablaze, the villages would have seen a dramatic display when visiting 
        their ‘privies’ at the bottom of the garden…</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The Starfish sites needed a complement of 24 
        personnel to operate fully and to be prepared for re-use soon after 
        being fired. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">
        Overall across the U.K., decoys of all types probably deflected over 2,000 tons of bombs. It worked 
        out into several thousand lives saved during the course of the war. Arborfield’s site was ready and waiting to do its part until at least 
        the middle of 1944 when we had air superiority, after which the enemy action switched 
        to Flying Bombs, making the decoys redundant.</span></p>
