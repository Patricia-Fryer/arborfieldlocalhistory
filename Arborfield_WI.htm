<p align="center"><b>HISTORY OF ARBORFIELD</b></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">The name is derived from the word "Feld",  Saxon for clearing or settlement, "The Settlement of Eber or Heber";  the spelling varied considerably:   Erburghefelde, Edburgefeld,  Heberfeld,  Arberfeld.  In the reign of James I,  Norden,  in his map of the Forest,  calls the place  "Awfield Cross",  and the modern form of Arborfield is met with for the first time in the 17th Century.</p>
<p align="justify">The Feld came from the clearing in Windsor Forest, as that extended many miles beyond, till the reign of Henry III, when the limit was fixed at the River Loddon, forming one boundary of the Parish.  As late as the reign of William IV, part of the Forest still extended up to the edge of Arborfield,  as part of Bear Wood in the next Parish of Hurst was Crown lands, till sold to Mr John Walter,  the founder of the Times newspaper,  in 1819.</p>
<p align="justify">The boundary between Arborfield and Swallowfield is still marked by a tree, called the Bound Oak, which must be quite 650 years old, called that for the reason that, when the bounds of a parish were beaten on Rogation Days, and prayers were said by the priest, boys were beaten on the Boundary so as to remember it;  in some places the lord of the manor was beaten.  This oak stands at the end of a lane which may possibly have been a Roman road, and has that tradition, joining the Devil's High Way, which was an early British road running straight from Staines to Silchester, the latter being a very important Celtic and then Roman town.  The Roman roads were made along British tracks.  When Mrs Bruce built Arborfield Court in 1906, having bought the land from John Simonds of Newlands, it was discovered that there had been a Celtic burial place there, a tumulus or barrow;  these places were always made on high ground.  The workmen digging the foundations for the house came across several urns containing bones and pieces of ancient pottery.  (These urns were at once taken in charge by the Rev. P. H. Ditchfield of Barkham Rectory).</p>
<p align="justify">According to the Victoria County History of Berkshire which is compiled from the Doomsday Book, the inhabitants of these "Settlements or Hamlets" were engaged in pastoral and agricultural pursuits,  but the greater part,  possibly the whole of this district,  was occupied before, and at the time of the Roman invasion A.D. 43 by the Attrebates, who were ancient inhabitants of Gaul and Belgium, in a part afterwards called Artois.  A tribe of these people came to Britain, and settled in Berkshire and Oxfordshire, making the Celtic town of Calleva Attrebatum, i.e. Silchester, theirs, and in their turn submitting themselves to Caesar and the Romans.</p>
<p align="justify">Arborfield is only mentioned in Doomsday as belonging to the lordship of the Bishop of Sonning.  This ancient lordship, included besides Arborfield, Hurst, Hinton, Newland, Ruscombe, Sandhurst, Sonning, Winnersh and Wokingham.  It was assessed at 60 hides of land, and had such extensive woodland as held 300 swine.  The fisheries on the Loddon at Whistley, part of Hurst, were valued at 3000 eels a year, while further up the river at Shinfield, 5 fisheries are mentioned worth 550 eels.  150 from the Mill Pool, which may possibly have been the pool at Arborfield, as Swallowfield, higher up stream, has its own mention.</p>
<p align="justify">Of the villages round,  Barkham,  Shinfield,  Swallowfield,  Finchampstead and Earley, were all "King's Demesene" at the time William I caused the Doomsday Book to be written.</p>
<p align="justify">In the 10th Century  Berkshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and possibly part of Hampshire, were under the Bishop of Sonning, or Ramsbury or Wilton, as different bishops called themselves after either place, they having a palace and estate in each.  These were finally all joined to Sherbourne in Dorsetshire, just before the Norman Conquest.  In 1075,  Herman,  Bishop of Sherbourne,  moved the Episcopal Seat to Old Sarum, later called Salisbury, and began to build the Cathedral there.  Berkshire remained in that Diocese till 1836, when it was joined to the Oxford one.</p>
      <p align="justify">The earliest mentioned "lord of the 
      manor" seems to have been a powerful Abbot called "Elsi" of the "Old 
      Minster" (the Cathedral Church) of Winchester. He held four manors and two 
      estates, of which Burghfield and Edburgefeld, dependent on Sonning, were 
      two. These he leased out, but there is no record to whom. Abbot Elsi was 
      at the "Old Minster" in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and was 
      outlawed after the Norman Conquest in 1070. Freeman, the historian, says 
      of this Abbot "that his whole life is wrapped in confusi on and 
      contradictions, and whose real history is well nigh as marvellous as 
      anything that legend could invent". It is unfortunate that there are no 
      legends about him left behind in Arborfield.</p>
      <p align="justify">This shows that the Manor of 
      Arborfield is a Saxon one. It consisted, as other manors did, of a castle 
      or fortified house, standing in the "lord's Demesne" (the Park lands); a 
      church with the churchyard round it, and quite close, a little house for 
      the Rectory. These all would generally be built close to a river (as in 
      Arborfield) so that there should always be fish on Fridays and fast days. 
      Along the river would be meadow lands.</p>
      <p align="justify">The peasants' cottages would be all 
      built close together, and near cross roads, with a bit of ground, each 
      surrounded by a fence. On the river would be built a mill belonging to the 
      lord. The miller working it would grind so much flour free for the lord, 
      and would also grind the corn for the people, who would pay him in kind, 
      so many handfuls of wheat or oats, or other food. Then there would be 
      three great fields; Eastfield for growing wheat; Westfield for growing 
      oats, and Southfield lying fallow, and growing weeds and rank grass for 
      the cattle to eat. Each year a different field would lie fallow, as there 
      were no artificial manures in those days. These fields might be anything 
      up to 200 or 500 acres each, and were divided into strips of 1 acre, with 
      a waste strip of about 1 ft of weedy grass between each. Every year these 
      strips were divided out by casting lots, to the freemen, and villeins 
      living on the manor. The freemen had quite a large number of these strips 
      every year, lent him and his heirs, by the lord, for which he had to pay 
      "Feudal Dues" and appear on certain days, every year, in the Lord's Hall; 
      also satisfy the lord with his behaviour and faithfulness.</p>
      <p align="justify">The villeins had a right to use 
      about 30 strips each, ten in each field. But he was not free to give all 
      his time to them. He would work for his lord perhaps two days a week (week 
      days) and give extra days (boon days) at busy times. These people could 
      not leave the district without the lord's permission.</p>
      <p align="justify">Then there were the "Serfs" - the 
      lowest people, who had to give all their time to the lord, and only had 
      the merest strip of land round their huts. Casting lots was considered the 
      fairest way of dividing these strips of land.</p>
      <p align="justify">Every Spring all the men entitled to 
      hold land on the manor, gathered together to meet the lord or his steward, 
      and the reeve (a man chosen by the people to be a sort of overseer or 
      foreman) and cast lots for the strips, till every man had his proper 
      share. In this way one man could not say he had all the bad land, or 
      another all the good. </p>
      <p align="justify">Round these big fields, there lay 
      waste and forest lands. The waste or common land was where the sheep were 
      kept, and fed, guarded by a shepherd. The pigs wandered in the brushwood 
      and undergrowth, tended by the swineherd. The horses, oxen, ploughs and 
      tools were owned by the lord. The villeins had to co-operate in using 
      them. The freemen, too, unless they owned their own, which they often 
      did.</p>
      <p align="justify">Sometimes the manors were owned by a 
      bishop, as in the case of Arborfield, or an abbey where the dues had to be 
      paid to them.</p>
      <p align="justify">A manor was self-supporting. Enough 
      food was grown for the people's use; their clothes were made of the wool, 
      spun and knitted in their own houses, or of leather prepared by 
      themselves. There was very little actual money in those days; a man's 
      wealth consisted of what amount of land he possessed; all trade was done 
      by bartering.</p>
      <p align="justify">About 1300 A.D. changes began. Wool 
      was exported to Flanders, and paid for in cash. The Crusaders wanted money 
      to take them to the Holy Land - and King Henry II asked his barons for 
      money to pay the soldiers with, instead of bringing their men to fight. 
      These all brought more money about the country. The lords of the manor 
      began to pay the men for their work, instead of making them give it, and 
      as they needed more money they enclosed more of the common lands, so as to 
      grow more sheep for the paying export of wool.</p>
      <p align="justify">But it was not till 1700 to 1800 
      that the big open fields began to be enclosed and divided up with hedges 
      and ditches.</p>
      <p align="justify">More and more corn was wanted, and 
      the little strips between each acre kept too much valuable land waste. 
</p>
      <p align="justify">This gives some idea of the manorial 
      system which had so much to do with the making of England.</p>
      <p align="justify">At the same time as Abbot Elsi owned 
      the Manor of Arborfield, in Edward the Confessor's reign, 1042 to 1066, 
      there lived on the South side of Arborfield a Thegn or Saxon Squire, by 
      name John Siemonds, and this is especially interesting as possible 
      descendants, bearing the same name, still own land in the parish.</p>
      <p align="justify">This John Siemonds was arraigned for 
      ecclesiastical misdemeanours (probably independence of thought) by the 
      Prior of Sonning on behalf of the Bishop of Ramsbury.</p>
      <p align="justify">A "Carucate" (a strip of land as 
      much as a plough could manage in a year) was demanded, as a punishment. 
      Siemonds must have refused to give the land, for he was remanded, and 
      called upon again for 5 hides of land scattered on his estate, a tithe of 
      it; this he was forced to give to the Prior.</p>
      <p align="justify">A hide of land varied according to 
      the locality, it might have been 60, 80, 100 acres or more, and might have 
      included a house, wood, meadow and pasture land, necessary for the 
      maintenance of a family. From this it would appear that this Saxon squire 
      must have owned a good deal of property. He would also have had to supply 
      armed men to fight for the King when called on to do so, as any owner of 5 
      hides of land had to provide one man.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Parish is mentioned in the 
      Exchequer Rolls for the year 1342, of which the following is the 
      translation - "Ebourwefel: Thomas Eleyre, John of Newland, Robert the 
      smith, and Adam the fowler, being sworn as to the value of the ninths of 
      sheaves, fleeces and lands of Ebourwefel say upon oath, that the aforesaid 
      ninths are worth at their highest value, five marks, in witness thereof 
      the aforesaid Thomas, John, Robert and Adam have appended their seals to 
      this schedule. Given at Newbury on the Thursday next after the Feast of 
      St. Valentine in the fifteenth year of King Edward the third, from the 
      Conquest".</p>
      <p align="justify">The mark was worth 13/4, and 
      allowing for the difference in the value of money to the present time 
      (1878) the Parish 536 years ago was worth about £600.</p>
      <p align="justify">In 1377 Arborfield contained 29 
      inhabited houses, 2 uninhabited ones, 42 families, and 171 persons, and as 
      a curious coincidence in 1800 there were again 171 persons.</p>
      <p align="justify">The old "Wooden Chapel of 
      Edburgefeld", dedicated after St. Bartholomew, and dependent on the Church 
      of Sonning, from where it received oil and chrism (consecrated oil), was 
      in existence in 1220, when the first mention of it occurs; it was built of 
      wood and although a good list of books and ornaments was found there, the 
      building is described to be in a disgracefully ruinous state, and 
      shamefully desecrated. "The churchyard was over-run with cattle and 
      uprooted by pigs". The Salisbury Diocesan Record adds that the aged priest 
      of Edburgefeld who lived at the Manor House with Richard Bulloc, was so 
      blind that he could not see to read, and did not know the canon of Mass, 
      nor the Gospels by heart, so was forbidden to officiate any more. [NOTE: 
      in later correspondence to Miss Simonds, Mrs Bullock Webster stated that 
      the translation of the Latin document was probably incorrect. It should 
      have read: "He could not render a single sentence of the Canon or the 
      Gospels correctly" owing to partial blindness]. </p>
      <p align="justify">"Reginald" Chaplain of Arborfield 
      was also another, who at the same visitation by the Dean of Salisbury, was 
      found to be most illiterate and ignorant.</p>
      <p align="justify">In 1224 the Chapel seems to have 
      been in charge of Priest John of Barkham, who was also remiss in the 
      oversight of his subordinates and the care of the Chapel. His assistant 
      was one Henry, who lived at Barkham, with John, and received a stipend of 
      20 shillings. It is quite a relief to find that at another Dean's 
      visitation to Sonning in 1300, though deficiencies were found in other 
      dependent Churches, Arborfield is not mentioned.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Chapel was in the grounds of the 
      manor and close to the river Loddon. In the reign of Henry III in the year 
      1256 it was rebuilt of chalk and flint, with a wooden tower at the West 
      end, carried on four wooden posts, containing 5 of the bells still in use 
      in the present Church.</p>
      <p align="justify">The chancel was 9 ft. by 24 ft., the 
      nave 58 ft. by 28 ft. There were 2 windows on the South side, with a door 
      in the centre of the wall. The East End window of 2 compartments, probably 
      of Flemish glass, was painted with the heads of Moses and Aaron, with the 
      Ten Commandments underneath. In moving the window to the new Church in 
      1863, it was unfortunately broken, the only piece remaining being Aaron's 
      head, which is now in a small window in that Church.</p>
      <p align="justify">The porch which looks so venerable 
      was erected, together with part of the West end wall in 1863. There is a 
      nave and two chapels, one containing tablets to the memory of the Conroy 
      family, and the other in the possession of the Hargreaves family, and 
      contains the tombs of the Standens. These two chapels were divided by a 
      wall in 1863.</p>
      <p align="justify">Evidently some addition was made to 
      the Church in 1631 as a beam with that date recorded on it was found and 
      placed over the entrance to the Conroy Chapel.</p>
      <p align="justify">The door is very old, with its heavy 
      iron-winged hinges extending the entire width of the door. On the South 
      wall are a piscina (a place for washing Holy Vessels) an aumbray (a 
      cupboard to contain them), a credence table and the remains of 3 stone 
      seats or sedilia.</p>
      <p align="justify">Sir John Conroy found some encaustic 
      tiles of red colour with pattern or circles and a flower shaped ornament 
      in the centre. The old font of wood is preserved at Arborfield Hall by Mr 
      J. R. Hargreaves, together with a curious old chalice and paten and an 
      ancient Bible. There is also an old leaden font bowl engraved:</p>
      <p align="justify">Arberfield 1726. M.W.  </font><font 
      size=6 face="ZapfDingbats,Monotype Sorts" 
      >c</font><font face="TimesNewRomanPS" 
      > R.S. Churchwardens</p>
      <p align="justify">An interesting feature of the old 
      Church was the paintings on the walls, only discovered when the roof was 
      taken off in 1863. All the masonry, except the West wall, which had been 
      the tower, bore traces of having been painted in fresco. </p>
      <p align="justify">On the East wall there were painted 
      3 figures, 3½ ft. high, each figure under a painted canopy. The one 
      nearest the window was an ecclesiastic, a mitre of a low triangular shape 
      and yellowish stripes representing a Pall. Under the middle canopy were 
      figures of the Blessed Virgin and Child; the third figure another 
      ecclesiastic.</p>
      <p align="justify">Above the figures the wall had been 
      painted with reddish brown paint to represent stones, with a little 
      ornament in each. There were similar paintings on the North side of the 
      window.</p>
      <p align="justify">On the North and South walls were 
      remains of painted drapery of the same colour, 2 ft. wide, commencing 
      about 2½ ft. from the ground, and above the same geometrical patterns.</p>
      <p align="justify">The probability is that these 
      paintings were whitewashed over in the time of the Commonwealth. Some 
      brass tablets remain, and are now fixed in the walls of the new church - 
      the oldest of these being to the memory of Thomas Haward, who was buried 
      in the nave: "Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord. Here lyeth the 
      body of Thomas Haward, Gent. with Anne his wife and Frances their only 
      child; who was married to William Thorold, Esquire, and had essue by him 7 
      sons and 7 daughters. This Thomas Haward departed the 4th of Novber An° 
      Dm. 1643." </p>
      <p align="justify">In the Conroy Chapel are tablets in 
      memory of that family, and also in it the old oak square altar rails are 
      preserved. </p>
      <p align="justify">In the other chapel on the North 
      side of the chancel (now the Hargreaves Chapel) which must originally have 
      been the "Lady Chapel" and has a stained glass window with the Blessed 
      Virgin and Child on it, is a "fair monument erected against the North 
      wall, whereon lie the statues of a Man and Woman in white marble with the 
      following description in Latin. The English thus:</p>
      <p align="justify">"William Standen of Arberfield, 
      renowned for this Descent from an Attrebatian, the year wherein James the 
      best of Kings was born, died May 18th. 1639, who in this Age detained 
      Justice upon Earth, gave hospitable Entertainment to the Banish'd, 
      cherish'd frozen Charity in his Bosom, lov'd Mankind in general as his 
      Friends, and his Friends as himself, who supported his Learning with 
      gravity, old Age with Sweetness and Alacrity, and Death with a Strong 
      Faith towards God. All that was mortal of him was deposited here, where 
      too, his dear Wife, dear upon all Accounts, Mary the fourth Daughter of 
      Samuel Backhouse of Swallowfield, Esqr: order'd herself to be interr'd, 
      who was conspicuous for her Chastity, Piety and Charity to the Poor; Hard 
      by the dearest of the Sons of Nicholas Love, Esqr. who was born April 
      11th, 1637, and died May 3rd 1638 on the day of Christ's Ascension into 
      Heaven is celebrated."</p>
      <p align="justify">Over the foregoing Monument hangs Mr 
      Standen's coat of armour, crest, mantle, helmet and a penon of his arms. 
      (Sir William Standen and Mary Backhouse were married in 1615. In a 
      conveyance of Edward Standen 10th August 1703, his mother is called 
      "Elizabeth, mother of Edward Standen").</p>
      <p align="justify">At the feet of the aforesaid 
      statues, is the figure of a child in white marble, lying upon its right 
      side.</p>
      <p align="justify">This description of the Standen 
      Monument is taken from the Antiquities of Berkshire, by Elias Ashmore, 
      Esq. in 1666. The monument is of alabaster, not marble. Sir John Conroy 
      restored it in 1843.</p>
      <p align="justify">William Standen's "descent from an 
      Attrebatian" shows that he was descended from the Belgian tribe of the 
      Attrebates, who occupied this country before the Roman invasion.</p>
      <p align="justify">The armour, etc. hanging over the 
      tomb has long since disappeared, and in its place on the wall is the 
      marble tablet with the coat of arms, erected by his wife in memory of Sir 
      William's grandson, Edward Standen; the inscription is in Latin, the gist 
      of the translation is:</p>
      <p align="justify">"Near his Father Edward and his 
      Mother Anne, and their little child born to them, Edward Standen Gent., 
      concerning whom many honest and laudable things would be allowed and might 
      be said, nevertheless nothing is said. His most beloved wife has wished an 
      account of the mutual and perpetual affection between themselves; grieving 
      to place this marble monument.</p>

      <p align="justify">The Bells of the Church were given 
      at different times, the oldest which is the smallest, weighing 3 cwt 2 
      qrs. 8 lbs. the tenor bell is stamped with a trefoil, lion's head and 
      coin, is one of the oldest known bells made in the Wokingham Foundry 
      during the 14th Century </p>
      <p align="justify">(The Foundry was an excellent and 
      important one; no name of an owner has been discovered earlier than the 
      middle of the 15th Century, but there is a bell from it cast in 1383. The 
      other known oldest bells from there are the 2nd at Appleford, 2 at Didcot, 
      3 in Hants. and 2 in Oxon. Later they introduced into the stamp a 
      beautiful set of crowned capitals with an initial Cross of Fleur-de-lis. 
      Roger Landen was the earliest known Wokingham Founder. The Foundry had a 
      branch in Reading, and John White, founder, migrated there, but the 
      Wokingham Foundry was subsequently revived, only Reading seems to have 
      absorbed the business, and was the home of several great bell founders, 
      the Knights, Carters, etc. Bryan Eldridge was making bells in Wokingham in 
      1624, so that the town took a leading part in the Industry.)</p>
      <p align="justify">2nd Bell. 1743: weighs 4 cwt. 2 qrs. 
      5 lbs. Was provided when the Rev. John Waterman was Rector, is inscribed 
      with the name of Robert Grace and Thomas Cowdery: Churchwardens. R. 
      Catlin. Fecit, 1743. The Church accounts of this year are in existence. 
      The bell according to them cost £5.13.0 to cast, 12/- to bring from 
      London, and was erected by a carpenter named Peter Cook at a cost of 
      £30.18.0. A larger part of the cost was defrayed by a rate, which was 
      supplemented by subscriptions of 10 guineas from Mr. Reeves of Arborfield 
      House and 56 guineas from Mr. Waterman.</p>

      Church is inscribed:</p>
      <p align="justify">"Prayse ye the Lord."</p>
      <p align="justify">Dated 1589, the year after the 
      Defeat of the Spanish Armada, possibly given as a thank offering for that 
      victory. It weighs 6 cwt 12 lbs.</p>
      <p align="justify">5th Bell is inscribed "Love God" 
      dated 1639 in the reign of Charles I, weighs 8 cwt 2 qrs 23 lbs.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">In 1862 when the new Church was 
      being built, a 6th bell was given by John Simonds of Newlands. Weighing 11 
      cwt. 2 qrs, 24 lbs., it had to be re-cast several times before it toned 
      with the other bells, and was made of old metals.</p>
      <p align="justify">There used to be great square pews 
      in the Church but most of them were done away with in May 1800.</p>
      <p align="justify">Between the South door and Altar 
      rails was a Three Decker Pulpit, with the Clerk's seat at the bottom, 
      above the seat from which the Clergymen read the services, and the 3rd 
      tier again above, from which the sermon was preached. At the West end was 
      a gallery in which the choir sat and sang to the strains of a barrel 
      organ, turned by a handle. There were 2 barrels of tunes, about a dozen 
      hymns in each; these barrels were changed the 1st Sunday every month.</p>
      <p align="justify">Before the barrel organ was 
      introduced, reed instruments were used to lead the singing. Mrs Barker, 
      now living at Barkham, remembers seeing them lying about her grandfather's 
      house; he was Thomas Appleby, clerk at Arborfield Church, and played 
      them.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Altar table, still in the use, 
      is the date of Queen Anne. The 2 Altar Chairs that of Charles II.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Registers of the Church begin in 
      1705, the older ones unfortunately were burnt.</p>
      <p align="justify">The beautiful old yew in the 
      churchyard is probably a "Consecration Tree" planted when the old Church 
      was consecrated, which would make it over 650 years old.</p>
      <p align="justify">The date of the old wooden font now 
      (1927) in the Chapel of the Old Church is, Mr Keyser thinks, about A.D. 
      1260, reign of Henry III. 2 pattens date 1793, inscribed Ricardus Hayes 
      Rector. 1 chalice 1849, silver. 1 silver flagon 1886. In 1939 a small 
      wooden barrel organ was found at the back of the Church organ - perhaps 
      100 years old. Canon Anderson pushed it around at a Fete in 1939 to help 
      raise money for the Village Hall. </p>
      <p align="justify">The next lord of the manor mentioned 
      after Abbot Elsi is "Osmond Bullock of Edburgfeld" who seems to have given 
      Priest John of Barkham charge of the Chapel. He also paid tithes to the 
      great monastery at Abingdon for some of his lands here.</p>
      <p align="justify">This family was a Norman one, came 
      across with William the Conqueror; when they came to Arborfield is not 
      known; they were distinguished people and held high positions in the 
      county. They still held the manor under the Lordship of Sonning as the 
      following declaration made by Gilbert Bullock in 1250 shows:</p>
      <p align="justify">"That all lands held by him in the 
      Manor of Sunninge was held subject to the Goodwill of the Bishop of 
      Salisbury, and bound himself and his heirs to deliver up to the Bishop or 
      his successors when called upon to do so." This Gilbert Bulloc was made 
      King's Reeve in 1275 i.e. a Trustee or Bailiff of the Crown Lands, which 
      he had charge of, and had to keep order among the people in the district. 
      [NOTE: Later correspondence from a descendant of the Bullock family says: 
      "I do not think you are right in describing my family as of <u 
      >Norman</u> origin. I have no doubt that Lower, in his 
      authoritative work on the subject of names, was right in deriving it from 
      the Saxon 'Bulluca'. Mr. Bullock Webster got an idea that it was a 
      corruption of the French 'Belloc', but there are various reasons against 
      this theory, and, I think, practically none for it!".]</p>
      <p align="justify">One Sir William Bullock, in the time 
      of Edward III, helped to make peace with the Scots.</p>
      <p align="justify">Robert Bullock, 1331, in his 
      capacity of King's Reeve, investigated the case for a lady, Agnes Neville, 
      daughter and heiress of Sir William Neville, Lord of the Manor of 
      Barkham.</p>
      <p align="justify">She claimed that a traitor to the 
      King, Edward III, Lord John Mautravers of Finchampstead, had stolen some 
      of her lands. Robert Bullock found this was so, and got her back her 
      lands, after which he married her to his son Gilbert, so joining the 
      property, and the lords of the two manors, into one, as they remained from 
      1340 to 1600. A wooden figure lying in the porch of Barkham Church is 
      supposed to be this lady.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Coat of Arms of the Bullocks is 
      3 bulls' heads, which would account for the two "Bull Inns", one in each 
      parish, as in those old times inns or alehouses were called after heraldic 
      signs.</p>
      <p align="justify">In 1388 Robert Bullock of Eberfeld, 
      late Sheriff of Oxford, "received a pardon from the King, for the escape 
      of a prisoner from Oxford Gaol, who escaped by misadventure and because 
      the Castle was ruinous", and in his will dated 1405 he "bequeth's my sowle 
      to God and my body to erthe. To the parisch church of Herberfeld xls. To 
      the parson of Herberfeld to have me in mynde xls; also (2) torches to the 
      church of Herberfeld." </p>
      <p align="justify">This man's grandson, another Robert, 
      was also an important person, and was appointed, according to the State 
      papers of 1478, Commissioner for the Conservancy of the River Thames, his 
      duties being "to survey the Thames, and its tributaries in the counties of 
      Berks, Bucks, and Oxfordshire, and to hear and determine all offenses 
      against the Statute of Magna Carta and other statutes, concerning the 
      erection of weirs, mills, stanks, piles and kiddles." One of his sons was 
      called "Hugh of ye Brazen Hand" and went to live in Shropshire. his uncle, 
      Richard Bullock of Barkham, bequeathed in 1534, 4d to the highwater in my 
      parische Churche of Barkh'm and 6d to buying a mass book for the same" and 
      various members of the family seem to have constantly left ornaments or 
      vestments to the churches about, and money for the "poore within the 
      Parishes of Erburgefeld, Barkham, Hurste, Shynfelde and Swallowfielde.</p>
      <p align="justify">They owned much property in these 
      parishes, also at "Wokefelde, Straffilde Mortymer, and Strafelde Say, and 
      Butlers lands in the Counties of Berks and Southampton." These latter seem 
      to have been given to one Thomas Bullock of Arborfield by "King Harrye the 
      VIII."</p>
      <p align="justify">This man was in 1544 returned among 
      the nobles and gentry of England, who supplied men and horses for the war 
      with France. His contingent consisted of "Archers eight and billmen 
      thirteen with harness". He died in 1558, and bequeathed "To the Churche of 
      Erburgefelde all suche ornaments, vestments and coopes, all of which I 
      bought of Thomas Champyon".</p>
      <p align="justify">The Barkham Registers are full of 
      the Bullock family and also of the Simonds family. The records at the 
      British Museum state "that in the reign of King John there was an exchange 
      of a piece of land in Arborfield between a Bullock and a Simonds".</p>
      <p align="justify">At the beginning of the oldest 
      Barkham Register dated 1538 there is a deed dated 1574:</p>
      <p align="justify">"To the faithful in Christ, and to 
      whomsoever this writing shall come, I, Thomas Bullock of Arborfield in the 
      County of Berks, gentleman, make over land to Thomas Symons and John Ball 
      for charitable purposes." The Bullocks continued to flourish, and have 
      large families till after 1590 when Thomas Bullock who was Sheriff of 
      Berkshire and Commissioner of the peace for the same county, by reason of 
      "an accumulation of debts" found it necessary to sell the family estates. 
      This was much objected to by the family, and particularly by his brother 
      William, who brought the case up before Chancery and the Star Chamber, 
      which case he lost, and was thrown into Fleet Prison for Contempt of 
      Court, where he stayed for some years, but on his release returned to his 
      home in Barkham and died there.</p>
      <p align="justify">Thomas Bullock sold his principal 
      estates, which are described as "the Manors of Arberfield, Barkham, Hurst, 
      Ockingham, Shingfield and Earley" to one Edward Standen of "Chancery" for 
      £4000, with the Previse that Thomas Bullock should remain in occupation at 
      an annual rent of £150, which he did till his death in 1595.</p>
      <p align="justify">The memorials of this family remain 
      in the Church, though there is evidence that there once stood in or near 
      the chancel the tomb of Richard the Sheriff, and that Thomas the 2nd was 
      buried beside his first wife in the "chapel adjoining" and Richard his son 
      "in the chancel near his ancestor."</p>
      <p align="justify">Whatever monuments there were seem 
      to have disappeared before the end of the 17th Century, for Ashmore makes 
      no mention of them in his "Antiquities." It is possible that they were 
      destroyed during the Civil War. It is pleasant to record that a descendant 
      of this family, the Revd. Llewellyn Bullock, came as locum tenens to 
      Arborfield in September 1914 at the time when he was busy compiling his 
      history.</p>
      <p align="justify">There is no record of what the old 
      manor house of Arborfield was like, but in 1603 Edward Standen built a 
      Jacobean house, which must have been very beautiful. The architect was 
      John Thorpe, a very celebrated one, who among other houses also built 
      Bramshill House in Hampshire, and Holland House in London.</p>
      <p align="justify">The staircase in Arborfield was so 
      wide that "a coach and 4 horses could have driven up it. The great hall 
      was furnished with 24 immense mahogany chairs with shields and arms of the 
      family carved on them, and rounded seats of crimson velvet. There were two 
      vast ballrooms and a large conservatory reaching to the river". (From a 
      description by Mrs George Pelsant Dawson taken from the History of the 
      Dawson family). The only buildings now remaining are the old Laundry and 
      the stables dated 1654.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Standens kept their heads and 
      their lands through the civil wars.</p>
      <p align="justify">Edward was followed by his son Sir 
      William, whose tomb has already been described. His son and grandson were 
      both Edward, and of the latter the following romance is told:</p>
      <p align="justify">The Rose Inn at Wokingham was kept 
      by a man called Mogg, who had two very pretty daughters, Molly and Sally. 
      Edward Standen fell in love with Molly, who would have nothing to say to 
      him; he was very attentive and one day, kept at the Inn "by the weather", 
      three poets from Binfield, Pope, Gay and Arbuthnot, happened to see him 
      with Molly, and noticed his "melancholy manner". So they composed a poem 
      in her praise, each contributing a verse. About Edward they wrote:</p>
      <p align="justify">"His brains all lost in a fog<br 
      >And nothing could give satisfaction<br 
      >But thinking of sweet Molly Mogg."</p>
      <p align="justify">Molly lived to be 76 and died 
      unmarried.</p>
      <p align="justify">Edward consoled himself, and married 
      a lady called "Eleanor". They had no children and at his death, at the age 
      of 27, in 1730, Arborfield House passed to a cousin, one Richard Aldworth, 
      but being a minor, his guardian sold it under an Act of Parliament to 
      Pelsant Reeves of Yorkshire. Richard Alderworth also owned Stanlake Park 
      near Twyford, and Billingbear Park, near Wokingham, and is father to the 
      1st Lord Braybrokes (who was raised to the peerage in 1797) and in whose 
      gift the living of Arborfield remained, till the advowson was sold by one 
      of them about 1876 to Mrs Hargreaves, owning Arborfield Hall.</p>
      <p align="justify">There is a monument in Arborfield 
      Church -</p>
      <p align="justify">"Sacred to the memory of Pelsant 
      Reeves, late of Arborfield House Esqre., who with remarkable serenity of 
      temper and cheerfulness of disposition, attained the age of 84. Beloved by 
      all who knew him and after a gradual decay during the last two years, 
      expiring without a groan 6th Feby. 1764. He married Jane, daughter of John 
      Mason of Kent, Esqre., by whom he had 6 children. Three who survived him, 
      and 3 who died young, who are buried with him in the adjacent vault. In 
      grateful remembrance of best husbands, his widow caused this monument to 
      be erected." That is all recorded of him. His son succeeded him. He was 
      magistrate, Deputy Lieutenant of Berkshire, and one of the Verderers of 
      Windsor Forest. He married Anne, and they had 2 children, Pelsant who was 
      killed fighting the French at Toulon 1793, and a daughter Elmira, heiress 
      of £10,000 and the estates, who married her brother's friend and brother 
      officer, George Dawson of Osgodley Hall, Yorkshire. These Dawsons are 
      descended from King Edward III, through his son Lionel, Duke of Clarence. 
      "Elmira" is described in a letter written by her father-in-law, Dec. 12th. 
      1794, as "an excellent young woman" !! John and Anne Reeves must have 
      given over Arborfield House to their daughter on her marriage, for they 
      both died at Andover, he on May 20th. 1814, and she May 7th, 1837, aged 
      90.</p>
      <p align="justify">In spite of the increase of fortune 
      brought to George Dawson by his marriage and owing to the vast expenditure 
      and the maintenance of Osgodley Hall, as well as Arborfield House, 
      financial troubles fell on the family and "one day" so rumour goes, the 
      Steward came to Mr Dawson just as he was going to London, and said what 
      bad repair the house was, "I wish the house was pulled down" was the 
      reply, which the Steward seems to have taken literally, and pulled down 
      part while his master was away!! How much truth there is in that report is 
      not known, but anyway there was a fire which helped to destroy it, and so 
      the beautiful house perished. This is the "Old House of Aberleigh" as Miss 
      Mitford calls it in "Our Village", a delightful description of the garden, 
      river and place, after its destruction, but her description of the family 
      is not quite accurate.</p>
      <p align="justify">The George Dawsons had one son, 
      George Pelsant, born 1802, who inherited both estates, was J.P. for 
      Berkshire, and for the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire, also Deputy 
      Lieutenant for that County. He married Jane, daughter of Henry Dod of 
      Burnham, Somersetshire.</p>
      <p align="justify">When he came into the property at 
      his father's death, he determined to rebuild the house, living in a farm 
      house while doing so. But before the house was finished, about 1840, he 
      sold the whole property to Sir John Conroy, Controller to the household of 
      the Duchess of Kent, Mother of Queen Victoria.</p>
      <p align="justify">There is still living (1922) in the 
      parish an old woman of 81, Mrs Love, whose grandfather was groom to the 
      Duchess of Kent. Mrs Love remembers hearing through her grandfather how 
      very much the Princess disliked Sir John Conroy, "because he was so unkind 
      to her pony and would let his children ride, the Princess saying it was 
      her pony, and only for her to ride"!! The Duchess of Kent gave a Sheffield 
      plated coffee set to this groom, which his daughter, Mrs Buckland (who 
      also lived in Arborfield with her husband, who was coachman to Sir John 
      Hayes) divided among her children, Mrs Love having the coffee pot, which 
      to her great regret she had to part with.</p>
      <p align="justify">As soon as the Queen came to the 
      throne in 1837, she parted with Sir John Conroy, who later came to live at 
      the Hall. He also lived in the farm house, till the Hall was finished, 
      which later became the home of his son Sir Edward and his wife, Lady 
      Alicia, daughter of Lord Ross. They enlarged it and called it Arborfield 
      Grange. It was sold by their son, Sir John Conroy, to Capt. and Mrs Stuart 
      Rickman in 1889, and after Capt. Rickman's death was sold again in 1917 to 
      Colonel and Mrs Churcher.</p>
      <p align="justify">Sir Edward found he could not afford 
      to live at Arborfield Hall, so sold it to Mr and Mrs Thomas Hargreaves in 
      1855. Shortly after, Mrs Hargreaves discovered that she was related to the 
      Dawson's, who had owned the place, through an American branch of that 
      family. Mrs Hargreaves enlarged the house again, and put in electric 
      light, using the old Paper Mill for making electricity. </p>
      <p align="justify">The Mill, which must have dated from 
      the old Manor House times, was established as a paper mill by Mr George 
      Dawson. In 1787 it was worked by a Mr Hodgson. In 1837 Thomas Miles, 
      papermaker, is mentioned in the registers. It was burned down or gutted in 
      1861. The miller lived in an old house called "Sans Souci" in the meadow 
      between the two arms of the river, close to the Mill. After the Mill was 
      burnt, it was let to various tenants, and finally pulled down by Mrs 
      Hargreaves.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Rectory, from an old engraving, 
      was a charming Jacobean house, but was pulled down, being in a bad state 
      of repair, and the present one built by Sir John Warren Hayes, Bart., soon 
      after he became Rector.</p>
      <p align="justify">In the village are a few old houses, 
      particularly the present post office where, in 1775, a watch and 
      clockmaker lived named Crutchfield. One of the watches he made is still in 
      the village, owned by Mrs Bentley. Bentley is an old name in the village; 
      in the year 1762, an ancestor of that name was paid 4/- for an account 
      against the Church Expenses.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Bull Inn is also very old. There 
      is also mention of that in the Church Rate book. "The Bull Alehouse rated 
      at 4d. to Mr May" dated 1750. This Inn is celebrated as being one of the 
      places where Queen Victoria stopped to bait her horses, as she drove from 
      Windsor to Stratfield Saye to pay a visit to the Duke of Wellington. 
      Outside the Inn, and across the road, a triumphal arch was built to 
      welcome her. Mrs Stone told how "Sir John Conroy of Arborfield House 
      threatened instant dismissal to any of his employees if they went to the 
      village to see Her Majesty go through. But old John Stone, he did not mind 
      what Sir John said, but put on his best clothes and went. No notice was 
      taken and he remained in the service of the Conroy's and Hargreaves till 
      he died well over 80.</p>
      <p align="justify">Old Thomas Appleby, for 33 years 
      clerk and bellringer at the Church, mentions this visit in his register of 
      Christenings and Burials - "Queen Victoria past throw Arborfield Jany 20th 
      1845 to Duck Wilintons and Returned the 23rd." These registers are in two 
      books, and are duplicates of the Church ones, kept by the old clerk and 
      his son from about 1804 to 1860; they are full of names of old 
      inhabitants, some of whose descendants are still in the parish and 
      neighbourhood. He records on September 30th 1819 "A streang traviling 
      woman found dead, berried", which must have caused a sensation.</p>
      <p align="justify">In 1862 the Old Church had fallen 
      into such bad repair, that it was thought advisable to build a new one. Mr 
      Hargreaves' grandfather, Sir William Brown, generously offered to build 
      it. The foundation stone was laid in August 1862: Sir J. W. Hayes, Rector. 
      Richard Wells, Henry Englefield, Churchwardens. Alexander Buchanan, 
      Curate. The dedication took place on June 19th 1863 by Samuel Wilberforce, 
      Bishop of Oxford.</p>

      <p align="justify">Mr Sale, who was Rector from 1666 to 
      1694 appears to have been at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford. In 1739 Mr 
      Waterman was Rector; in 1797 Mr Richard Hayes died, who had held the 
      living for 42 years. He was followed by Mr Henry Hodgkinson, who was 
      private chaplain to Lord Braybrooke, and one of his duties then was to see 
      Lord Braybrooke's guests under the table; report says "As a reward for 
      such a steady head" he was given the living of Arborfield! He also held it 
      for 42 years. He married Sarah, daughter of Anne and George Courtup of 
      Reading, who died with her infant son in 1804, two years after their 
      marriage. He died Aug. 20th 1839, 86 years of age, "and the last end of 
      him was Peace"! A story is told of him and old Mr Charles Simonds of 
      Newland Lodge. "One Sunday, Mr Hodgkinson read out some banns during the 
      service. Mr Simonds looked up and called out "Henry, I forbid the banns". 
      "Why Charles?" "Because he can't afford to keep her!"</p>
      <p align="justify">His successor, the Revd. Sir John 
      Warren Hayes was inducted on the 14th September 1839. From a letter 
      written by Anne Lady Hayes to her daughter, Mrs Robertson in Calcutta, 
      about her son John, dated June 2nd, 1832: "John has just purchased the 
      next presentation to a small living in Berkshire, about 14 miles from 
      Wargrave, the incumbent in his 80th year, but he says that he thinks his 
      life promises fair for a few years longer". (John paid £250 for the next 
      presentation to Arborfield in Berkshire). "Mr Ash, who visited Mr 
      Hodgkinson, says the Parsonage House, tho' small, was comfortable and kept 
      with extreme neatness, and the old Devine, who is hospitality itself, 
      continued to see a great deal of company in it. I wish John could meet 
      with a good wife, who would be satisfied with his small means".</p>
      <p align="justify">From a letter of John Warren Hayes, 
      July 25th 1834: "I do not make enquiries about Arborfield, but I believe 
      the old gentleman is perfectly stout and likely to live as long as I may. 
      The situation is certainly desirable, only 4 miles from Reading on the 
      Windsor side, but the house is bad and will require to have three parts of 
      it taken down and rebuilt". (The old "Devine" died in 1839)</p>
      <p align="justify">The Revd. Sir John Warren Hayes 
      retired after 40 years at the age of 80, dying in 1896 at the great age of 
      97. He married Ellen, daughter of Mr George Beauchamp of the Priory, Beech 
      Hill. Their daughter, Ellen Anne, married John Simonds of Newlands in 
      1868. Sir John was very much beloved by everyone, and the older people 
      about still remember him, and tell stories of his many kindnesses. When he 
      first came, there was an empty Church and a flourishing Chapel; but in a 
      very short time the Chapel was pulled down, as no-one went to it, and 
      those who did not go to Church regularly every Sunday could be counted on 
      two hands. The men went in the morning and the women afternoon in the 
      winter, evening in the summer.</p>
      <p align="justify">On Sir John Hayes retiring, the 
      living was presented to the Revd. Lionel Welsh, who had been an Army 
      Chaplain. He exchanged after a few years with the Revd. John Jones, Rector 
      of Henley, Yorkshire. He retired in 1898, when Mrs Hargreaves presented 
      the living to the Revd. J. A. Anderson, curate of St. John's Blackheath, 
      who retired in 1945.</p>
      <p align="justify">Some of the Church expenses in the 
      oldest Church Rate Book are of interest:</p>
      <p align="justify">1746 item pd. for Stocks and 
      whipping post. 12/-</p>
      <p align="justify">item pd. for Clerks Sallary and 
      Washing and Lining £2. 12. 6.</p>
      <p align="justify">Sept. 1747 item pd for Chickon 
      (catching) of 65 dozen of sparrows 0. 5. 5.</p>
      <p align="justify">1750 pd for three dussen of Sparros 
      6d.</p>
      <p align="justify">In 1754, the price of 'three duzen 
      of Sparros' had gone up to 1/-.</p>
      <p align="justify">The same year the Churchwardens paid 
      2/6 to "a Company of Dostrossed Sailors".</p>
      <p align="justify">1749 £2. 2. 0. was paid for 'Singing 
      Books'.</p>
      <p align="justify">The bellringers were paid 12/6 a 
      year, the Clerk £2. 10. 0.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">The Church expenses varied, being as 
      low as £7. 0. 9½ and never above £35. At Easter 1789, a 2d. rate was made 
      to pay for them, and the Churchwardens were "16/9½ out of Pocket".</p>
      <p align="justify">Expenses were provided by a 1d. or 
      2d rate in the £1 until 1874, when at a vestry meeting it was "determined 
      to provide for the expenses of the year" by subscriptions, and "an 
      offertory should be established". </p>
      <p align="justify">There are constant references in 
      this Church Rate Book to a rate paid by the Rector on the "Piddle", 
      sometimes spelt Pightel or Piddal, a little piece of land belonging to the 
      Parish; also "Masons Piddle" with a rate paid by Mr Hodgson of the Mill; 
      and "Olivers Piddle" rate paid by Thomas Simonds of Newland.</p>
      <p align="justify">An interesting deed in the same book 
      relates to the alteration of 2 of the parish roads. In 1843 Sir Edward 
      Conroy wished to divert the Drive to Arborfield Hall, which was also the 
      public road to the Church, going from near the entrance to Arborfield 
      Grange, which was then only a farm house, in a direct line to the Church, 
      diagonally across a piece of the Park called Church Close, also another 
      road called the Cross Road, which went from the Newland Road into the 
      Causeway (the road going from Arborfield Cross to the bridge over the 
      river) leaving the Lake now in the Grange grounds on the right. </p>
      <p align="justify">These two roads Sir Edward wished to 
      block, and make two new ones. The one carrying on the Newland Road, 
      straight past the Rectory, over the Church Close to the Church, 
      substituting that for a certain public footpath, the width of 3 ft. ("to 
      be used by the said parishioners of the said Parish of Arborfield, as a 
      path to Arborfield Church on Sundays, and on those days in which divine 
      service shall be performed at the said Church").</p>
      <p align="justify">The other road, now known as the New 
      Road, going from the Newland Road across a corner of waste land, the 
      property of John Walter of Bear Wood, then straight across a field of Sir 
      Edward Conroy's known as the "Hop Garden", coming into the Causeway, 
      exactly opposite the village pound (which has ceased to exist).</p>
      <p align="justify">A vestry was called, and "having 
      maturely considered the proposal", the exchange was agreed to. "Sir John 
      W. Hayes, Bart., Rector and Chairman, James Fuller and John Pither, 
      Churchwardens and Overseers". The others who signed the deed were John 
      Conroy, Charles Simonds, Edward Hewitt, William Cordery.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Churchwardens, Overseers of the 
      Parishes, had to see to the relief of all the poor, to mend the roads, and 
      do the work within their bounds, which work is now done by the District 
      Council.</p>
      <p align="justify">Mr John Simonds has a copy of a 
      deed, dated 5th April 1720, which was given to the Churchwardens and 
      Overseers of the Liberty of Newland by "two of his Majesty's Justices of 
      the Peace, of the County of Berks", namely Fran. Wightwick and Charles F. 
      Palmer (Probably the Mr Charles Palmer, M.D., who married Anne Standen, 
      née Aldworth) ordering and requiring them in his Majesty's name "to 
      forthwith remove and convey, a certain Thomas Vinor and his wife to the 
      parish of Stratfield Turgis, and to deliver them together with this 
      Warrant or Order to the Churchwardens and Overseers of the poor of that 
      Parish" because "Thomas Vinor labourer and Sarah his wife had lately 
      intruded themselves into your said Liberty of Newland - there to inhabit 
      as parishioners contrary to the Laws relating to the Settlement of the 
      poor, and are there like to become chargeable if not prevented!"</p>
      <p align="justify">A great variety of things were paid 
      for by these Overseers, "for stockings and apron 5/5½"; "for breaches and 
      shoes for a boy going to servis at Bagshot"; "for nursing Dame Bumford 
      9/3, for her coffin 14/- and her shroud 3/6". In 1807, "Gave William 
      Merricks in the smallpox 5/-". "Paid Caleb Edward Yeacocke Oct. 1812 £1. 
      1. -. for serving of office of Constable one year". The latter was for 
      many years a Newland Overseer. He lived in a farm which stood between the 
      New Church and the Rectory, also at Moat Farm and Bartletts. He had a 
      large family. One of his sons, also Caleb Edward, became Bailiff to the 
      Simonds of Newland and served in that capacity during three generations, 
      from the age of 19 to his death at 95, and continued in his father's steps 
      as Overseer.</p>
      <p align="justify">The same names occur for generations 
      in these old rate books, still a few carrying on - Allwright, Bentley, 
      Cordery, Love, May, Simonds, Milam or Mileham, etc. Halfaker seems an old 
      Newland name - a Charles Halfacre in 1818. In 1827 money was given to 
      "George Halfaker to bye some leather to make his boy a pare of shoes 7/-." 
      In Nov. 1921, Arthur John Bentley married Beatrice Halfacre of the 
      neighbouring parish of Shinfield, while a month earlier Miss Fouracre 
      married, whose father owns White Farm, Arborfield.</p>
      <p align="justify">Of Modern History in the Parish, the 
      chief things of interest are the making of the Army Remount Depot in 1906, 
      the Government first renting the land from Mr A. F. Walter of Bear Wood 
      and then buying it. During the war thousands of horses and mules passed 
      through this depot.</p>
      <p align="justify">The change of owners of Arborfield 
      Court, Mrs Bruce selling it to Mr and Mrs Prescott, Mr Prescott being 
      descended from the family of Oliver Cromwell's son Henry, through Mr 
      Prescott's great grandmother.</p>
      <p align="justify">The erection on the Green in March 
      1919 of the Cross in memory of those men of Arborfield and Newland who 
      gave their lives for their King and Country in the Great War. At the same 
      time, a bronze tablet was placed in the Church with the same 22 names.</p>
      <p align="justify">In May 1927, the three new East End 
      windows in Arborfield Church were dedicated. In memory of Ellen Anne 
      Simonds and Captain Stuart H. Rickman. Given by John Simonds of Newlands 
      and Mrs Stuart H. Rickman. Made by Heaton, Butler and Baynes of 
London.</p>
      <p align="justify">In October 1931, the Village Hall 
      was opened; built on ground given by Mr John Simonds of Newlands and his 
      son, Mr J. H. Simonds. Mr Simonds also started the fund for the building 
      four years before; the money was practically all collected before the 
      building started. Architect - Mr W. R. Howell of Reading. Builder - Mr F. 
      J. Milam of Finchampstead. </p>
      <p align="justify">In 1939, the "Standen" Altar Tomb 
      and Edward Standen's mural monument were moved to the New Church; also the 
      old wooden font, possibly late 1260.</p>
      <p align="justify">In 1944 the Tudor altar rails were 
      moved from the Old Church for safe-keeping to the Rectory, and in 1946 
      were restored to be used again in the New Church.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>OLD 
      CUSTOMS</b></p>
      <p align="justify">The only old customs remembered are 
      the Mummers and the Whitsuntide Club days.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Bull Inn Club was held 
      Whitmonday.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Swan Inn Club the following 
      Wednesday.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Club men all wore their best 
      clothes with tall hats, and a favour of the Club colours fastened in them; 
      the children all wore white.</p>
      <p align="justify">The following is a description of 
      these days written by Mrs Barker, living at Barkham who, till her 
      husband's death in November 1928 lived in Arborfield, as her ancestors, 
      Saunders and Applebys did before her:-</p>
      <p align="justify">I think the Club time at Whitsuntide 
      as the event I remember most, as that was the only time we heard a band: 
      when the sound of the drum coming up the Causeway, as we called it, was 
      heard, the children ran to the Cross by the Bull. There the Club members 
      were gathered, and the names called out before going to the Old Church for 
      Service. Then the bells used to ring and the Band play down the Park. The 
      flag was placed in front of the gallery and people took their seats in 
      Church. On that day the poor folks were allowed to sit in the big pews 
      belonging to the gentry. I remember sitting in a large square pew with 
      green plush lining, and cushions to match, and never was the Old Hundredth 
      Hymn sung with more heartiness than it used to be then. The organ in the 
      gallery was played by turning a handle. After the Service the bells were 
      rung again, and all went back as far as the Rectory; there the Band went 
      to the front of the house and played some tunes. Then all returned to the 
      Bull where dinner was served to the Club members and the Bandsmen. I am 
      forgetting old blind John! He was always a notable figure and marched with 
      his hand on the shoulder of one of the Bandsmen, wherever they went. I 
      ought to mention the flag; it was grand dark blue silk with yellow fringe, 
      and on it the words "Arborfield Benefit Society". After dinner the Club 
      members and Band, and all the villagers that could, used to go to Newland; 
      at the time, it was the old house that stood where there is still a bunch 
      of evergreens and oak trees. There the Family were seated at the front. 
      John used to whistle; he would imitate all the birds exactly. After, the 
      band played again, and all marched to the "Mole Inn" where refreshments 
      were freely taken, then back to the Bull for a time. After, another march 
      to Bramshill Hunt for more refreshments.</p>
      <p align="justify">I forget what part of the day the 
      running took place. There were things to be won hung on the sign at the 
      Swan, and the runner had to run from the Bull there. I call to mind once 
      there was a chemise, and the winner had to put it on and wear it down the 
      street!! But there were chiefly shirts and red handkerchiefs. Then there 
      was the Greasy Pole, with a leg of mutton on the top to be climbed for. It 
      was a man named Mosdell that used to climb; the boys would throw him sand 
      to help him, and after many slides down, he would reach it and carry it 
      off in triumph. There used to be Merry-go-rounds with horses, and two 
      little carriages for girls that were pushed round by hand; not many times 
      round for a penny. Then lots of stalls with gingerbreads, cakes, sweets 
      and biscuits, and all sorts of funny little toys. I remember Mrs Marks 
      with her twin babies in a box under her stall, and Sally Smith with her 
      nuts and gingerbreads.</p>
      <p align="justify">I remember there used to come a 
      queer couple that sang songs; the man and woman both had but one eye, and 
      they sang a verse each.</p>
      <p align="justify">After the band had gone, the dancing 
      took place in the long room to a fiddle and piccolo. This was Monday, and 
      about the same on Wednesday in Whitsun week". The man who played the 
      fiddle was blind Jimmy Cordray from Farley Hill.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Berkshire word "Deedily" can be 
      used here, for the "great interest" Mrs Barker took in writing this 
      description.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>The 
      Mummers</b></p>
      <p align="justify">Used to come regularly every 
      Christmas to visit the houses. There were about 6 actors who, according to 
      the description of Mr Frederick Wheeler who acted Boldroomer, "wore 
      dresses of glaze linen, different shades, and coloured pompadore, cut in 
      strips and sewn on shirts and tunics. Zulu hats, trimmed with ribbon and 
      grasses at the sides; glaze linen sashes and wooden swords". Sometimes the 
      dresses were covered entirely with strips of coloured paper, and after the 
      play they always sang one or more songs. The words are as near as can be 
      remembered:</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>GEORGE AND

      <p align="justify">"Messuage" - house - premises.</p>
      <p align="justify">A villein generally held a virgate 
      of land (30 acres) or ½ a virgate. They held their land at the will of the 
      lord, and could not leave the manor without his consent. They paid him 
      some rent, and were also bound to give so many days labour in the year in 
      ploughing, harvesting and other work. On the death of a villein a heriot 
      was payable to the lord, consisting of an ox or horse, or some such 
      payment, but their holdings were hereditary "passing by the lord's 
      re-grant from father to son by the rule of primogenture". They could make 
      wills, but could not marry without the lord's consent or sell an ox 
      without his licence.</p>
      <p align="justify">Besides the Villeins there were 
      borders or cottagers, bord being a Saxon word for cottage. These held 
      generally a small holding of land, five acres or less, and had to render 
      service of all sorts to the lord, perhaps a day a week, and give small 
      tributes such as a clock or hen or eggs at stated times.</p>
      <p align="justify">A hide of land. 120 acres more or 
      less.</p>
      <p align="justify">A carucate of land was the land of a 
      plough or plough team. It varied according to the lightness or heaviness 
      of the soil, and according to the strength of the team, but a normal 
      carucate may be reckoned at 120 acres.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Church of St. Bartholomews at 
      Arborfield was a "Peculiar" to the Deans of the Bishoprick of Sonning, 
      later Sherborne, Old Sarum and Salisbury. What is "Peculiar"? - "A 
      'Peculiar' is a church or parish or group of parishes outside the 
      jurisdiction of the bishop of the dioceses. In the Middle Ages there were 
      very many of these, their privilege arising from various causes, usually 
      through a connection with the Crown or with a monastery to which this 
      exemption had been granted by the Pope. The Archbishop of Canterbury also 
      had many Peculiars, that is parishes over which he and not the Bishop of 
      the diocese had jurisdiction. Among these were Bocking and Stamford, whose 
      incumbents are still called Deans for this reason.</p>
      <p align="justify">The gradual process of abolishing 
      these privileges and bringing such places under the ordinary jurisdiction 
      of the bishop began in the sixteenth century and was, for all practical 
      purposes, completed in the nineteenth. Only a few now remain, of which the 
      best known is Westminster Abbey and St. George's Chapel, Windsor. These 
      are still completely independent of the bishops in whose dioceses they are 
      situated.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Thorolds are also an Arborfield 
      family.</p>
      <p align="justify">Sir William Standen and Mary 
      Backhouse were married in 1615.</p>

      <p align="justify">Edward Standen married Anne Aldworth 
      daughter of Richard Aldworth of Stanlake Park of the County of Wilts; her 
      brother was Charles Aldworth, who was when she married about 1701, at Mary 
      Magdalen College, Oxford. It must have been his son Richard who inherited 
      Arborfield Hall as a manor, and his guardians sold it. Anne Aldworth 
      married secondly Charles Palmer* of Wokingham. Edward Standen's sister 
      Susannah was buried at Finchampstead Dec. 2nd 1723 (see Chronicles of 
      Finchampstead, W. Lyon, Page 1280), and Martha married Joseph Butter of 
      Reading, Esqre. Sir William left his daughter Susannah, or Susan 
£1050.</p>
      <p align="justify">* This Dr Charles Palmer is 
      described in various deeds between 1700 and 1712 as "M.D. of Arborfield", 
      died in 1712; he succeeded his father to Luckly and other estates in 1670, 
      and his brother Richard, on his death, to East Court Manor, 
      Finchampstead.</p>

      are the initials of Joseph Carter, and in between the initials is a shield 
      on which is engraved a bell between the letters R.M.</p>
      <p align="justify">Joseph Carter was in 1578, perhaps 
      earlier, manager of the ancient Reading Bell factory. He bought the 
      Whitechapel Foundry from Robert Mot, who started one in 1570. Carter had a 
      way of copying Mot's devices and inscriptions on bells, and most likely 
      before he actually bought the business he had access to Mot's patterns, so 
      that probably the 4th bell was cast by Cater under such conditions.</p>

      ruinous was taken down, and the Vane became the property of Sir Edward 
      Conroy Baronet. It was put upon this Dove-Cot at Arborfield Grange in 
      recollection of the old and picturesque Church of Arborfield on the 23rd 
      Feby. 1869."</p>
      <p align="justify">November 1826.</p>
      <p align="justify">Old James Taylor in the village said 
      that he had helped to pull down the Church Tower; the men put a rope round 
      the wooden steeple and first pulled it over, it was so rotten. He also 
      said that in pulling down the Church, they came upon an old bowl built in 
      the wall, close to the door "Sir John" Hayes used. "It looked like 
      alabaster" and "very roughly hollowed out with a chisel". Watts had to get 
      rid of the things and rubble, so no doubt threw it away, as is supposed to 
      have happened to the Pewter Chalice. The alabaster bowl was evidently a 
      Holy Water Stoup. The rubble from the Church was used to make up the road 
      across the big field from Arborfield Hall Farm to "Cocklebury mansions", 
      the 2 old Tudor Cottages, standing by the land and the big field, pulled 
      down Oct. 1926, the bricks and tiles were sold to Mrs Slater Booth, living 
      in Hampshire at [there is a space in the handwritten document here]. The 
      rest of the rubble was thrown in the gravel pit by Arborfield Hall Farm. 
      James Taylor also said that (what is now Church Copse) used to be a kiln 
      for making small drain pipes.</p>

      present Church to the farm, he stopped him and said he was not to walk 
      across his field, at which the sweep said he would, so Mr Dawson seized

      sailor to manage the ropes of the Queen's vessel, whenever she should pass 
      over to Normandy. Hence it is said, the name of "Corde de Roy". In the 
      list of Knights of Berks, temp. Ed. I., the name of Sir Thomas Cowdray
