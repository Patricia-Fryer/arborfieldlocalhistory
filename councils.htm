<h1>Overseers and Surveyors</h1> 
       
<p class="stbody">Prior to Local Government re-organisation in the late 
1800's, the parish was administered by the church, with the <b>Overseers of the 
Poor</b> and the <b>Road Surveyors</b> reporting to the Churchwardens. Before the days of 
local Rates or Council Taxes, the Church used to set a <b>'Tithe Apportionment<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">' 
to pay for the poor. In the late 1830's, Arborfield Parish drew up a new Tithe 
Apportionment map which you can see by 
clicking </span><a href="tithemap.htm">here</a><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. 
The Society has a 'Terrier' (list of landowners) on its Data CD.</span></b></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The rural poor had to resort to the 'Parish' when 
they fell sick. They weren't free to move from one village to another because 
they could become a burden on the new parish - and they were often taken back to 
their home village by force.&nbsp; In 1787 the Rector of next-door Barkham made 
a study of several rural families in his parish, publishing the results in 1795 
as 'The case of Labourers in Husbandry', showing that they could barely survive 
on their regular income - click </span>
<a href="http://www.berkshirerecordoffice.org.uk/documents/echo19.pdf">here</a><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
for more details.</span></b></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">When they were really poor, they were committed to the 
Workhouse. There was a very old Workhouse in Reading at the Oracle and another 
in Wokingham at Denmark Street (then called 'Down Street'). After 1837,<b>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">parishes were grouped together into </span>Poor 
Law Unions<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, </span>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">and 
new Workhouses were built. Arborfield and Newland were part of Wokingham Poor 
Law Union, and a new Workhouse was built in Barkham Road, which is now Wokingham 
Hospital. In Reading, the new Workhouse in Oxford Road eventually became Battle Hospital).&nbsp; 
There's an excellent Web site on </span>Workhouses<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
by Peter Higginbotham, which you can explore by clicking </span>
<a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~peter/workhouse/">here</a><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">.&nbsp;
</span></b> </p> 
       
<h1>Schools</h1> 
       
<p class="stbody">There was a <b>National School</b> in Greensward Lane which lasted 
until the 1870's when a new Church School was built on School Road. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The
<a href="http://www.arborfield.wokingham.sch.uk/history.htm"> <b>village schoo</b>l</a> in School Road was connected with Arborfield Parish Church, and covered not only Arborfield and&nbsp; Newland but 
also the neighbouring parish of Barkham.&nbsp; It taught all age-groups until new 
Secondary Schools were built in Wokingham, followed later by the <b>
<a href="http://www.thecoombes.com">Coombes Infant 
School</a></b>, so that it now teaches only from ages 7 - 11. The school served as a 
base for Newland Parish Council for many years.&nbsp; After 1888, education was 
the responsibility of the new<b> Berkshire County Counci</b>l, based in Shire 
Hall at the Forbury in Reading (now the Crown Court building)</p> 
       
<h1>Councils after 1894</h1> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b>Parish of Arborfield</b> looked after the old settlement by 
the River Loddon, plus farmland to the south of Arborfield Cross and the "Bull" 
public house,&nbsp; plus the houses and farms near the "Bramshill Hunt" public 
house. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The rest of the area including <b>Bearwood</b>, <b>Carter's Hil</b>l, 
<b>Hughes 
Green</b> <b>and Arborfield Cross</b> belonged to the <b>Liberty of Newland</b>, which was part of 
the parish of <b>Hurst</b>. This enormous parish also included Winnersh and extended in 
the other direction to Twyford, which had been a small settlement until the 
Great Western Railway built a station there. To complicate matters further, 
Hurst was a 'Peculiar' of Wiltshire, while Arborfield was in Berkshire.&nbsp; </p> 
       
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">A "Liberty" is defined as:</span></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
  <p class="Stbody">An area situated outside a borough in 
  which freemen had certain rights of pasture, etc;&nbsp;or:&nbsp;  </p>
    <li>
  <p class="Stbody">A group of manors,&nbsp; the lord of which 
held certain privileges of the Crown.&nbsp; The sheriff's authority was excluded and 
the lord had the return of writs.&nbsp; It is alternatively called a "Soke".</p>
    </li>
</ol>
       
<p class="stbody">As can be seen in the Minutes of <b>Newland Parish Council</b>, part 
of <b>School Road</b> was a detached part of <b>Wokingham Without</b> for some years, and its 
inhabitants had to travel a long way to vote on Polling Days.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The Parish Councils of Arborfield and Newland were formed in 
1894, and were quite separate from each other until 1947. This is one reason why 
the Village Hall, built in the 1930's, is administered by a charity, the <b>Village 
Hall Management Committee</b>.</p> 
       
<h1>Parish Council Minutes</h1> 
       
<p class="stbody">Minute Books and other documents of the two Parish Councils 
are now lodged with the <b> <a href="http://www.berkshirerecordoffice.org.uk">
Berkshire Record Office</a></b>. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Extracts of the old <b>Arborfield Parish Council</b> and <b>
Newland Parish Council</b> Minutes can be found by clicking the links on the 
left.</p> 
       
<h1>Parish Cottages</h1> 
       
<p class="stbody">After 1894, Council Housing was provided by <b>Wokingham Rural 
District Council</b>, but the Parishes still had their own stock of houses which were 
gradually closed down, usually after being condemned for being 'unfit for human 
habitation'.&nbsp; Click <b><a href="parishcottages.htm">here</a></b> to find 
out about the Parish Cottages in Arborfield and Newland.</p> 
       
<h1>Water Supply</h1> 
       
<p class="stbody">Most villagers relied on water drawn 
      from public wells until&nbsp;the mid-20th Century - hence 
      <strong>'Whitewell Close'</strong>. The big houses usually had their own 
      water supplies, but <strong>Wokingham Rural District Council</strong> 
      (WRDC)&nbsp;spent much time in its early years&nbsp;trying to arrange 
      mains&nbsp;water supply 
to its far-flung villages, particularly in its central parishes.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Eventually, a <strong><a 
      href="C20/councils_water_supply_1933.htm">water pumping 
      station</a></strong> was opened by <strong>E. M. Sturges</strong>, leader 
      of WRDC, in July 1933. The chairmen of both Arborfield and Newland Parish 
      Councils attended the grand opening at <strong>Arborfield Mill</strong>. 
      The water main passed through Arborfield Cross and Barkham on its way to 
      hill-top reservoirs off <strong>Highland Avenue, 
      Bearwood</strong>   
        .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
       
<h1>Electricity&nbsp;Supply</h1> 
       
<p class="stbody">At first, only a few&nbsp;of the largest 
      dwellings had&nbsp;electricity for lighting, because it needed to be generated on-site.&nbsp;In the 
      early 1930s the <strong>National Grid</strong> &nbsp;erected pylons 
      across Arborfield and Barkham, prompting&nbsp; <strong><a 
      href="C20/memories_no_mod_cons.htm">discussion by Wokingham Rural District 
      Council</a> 
        </strong> in late 1934, expressing fears that locals wouldn't 
      see the benefit for a long time yet. For many, it took 
               
        
at least 20 years before they had mains electricity.</p>
      <p class="stbody">Many householders did have an 
      accumulator, but only&nbsp;in order to power the&nbsp;'wireless', and 
      <strong>Bentley's Garage</strong> provided a service of 
      charging-up&nbsp;accumulators.&nbsp;Only a small part of&nbsp;<strong><a href="church_new_PCC_1935.htm">St. 
      Bartholomew's&nbsp;Church</a> 
      </strong> (the Chancel) was lit by 
      electricity until the late 1940s, powered by accumulators. Even in the 
      1970s it was the practice to switch off most of the lights in the church 
      during the sermon; perhaps this&nbsp;was a hang-over from the 
      days&nbsp;before mains electric power, when the electric charge needed to 
      be conserved.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"> 
               
        
        Mains power remained 
      intermittent&nbsp;until the late&nbsp;1970s because of the demands 
      placed&nbsp;on the&nbsp;local network; power cuts&nbsp;were a frequent 
      part of Arborfield life until the system was 
               
        
        beefed-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
