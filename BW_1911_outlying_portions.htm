	  <p class="auto-style2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"></span><strong>
	  <span class="auto-style1">GREAT SALE OF FREEHOLD PROPERTIES AT WOKINGHAM.</span></strong></p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The great sale of the outlying portions of 
	  the Bear Wood Estate, which had been in possession of the <strong>Walter 
	  family</strong> for nearly a century, consequent on the lamented death of
	  <strong><a href="C20/families_arthur_walter.htm">Mr. Arthur Fraser Walter</a></strong>, 
	  was held on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday last, at the <strong>Drill 
	  Hall, Wokingham</strong>, and attracted large numbers of persons each day.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Messrs. Trollope, the well-known estate 
	  agents of Mount-street, Grosvenor-square, were entrusted with this 
	  important sale, which is the largest property sale ever held in Wokingham. 
	  The solicitors for the estate are Messrs. Cooke, Cooper and Harry, of 
	  Wokingham, and Messrs. Soames, Edwards and Jones, of Lennox House, 
	  Norfolk-street, Strand, W.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Carefully compiled particulars and plans had 
	  been prepared of the various lots, which numbered 124, and comprised 
	  freehold properties in the parishes of <strong>Wokingham</strong>, <strong>
	  Arborfield</strong>, <strong>Barkham</strong>, <strong>Finchampstead</strong>,
	  <strong>Newlands</strong> [sic], <strong>Sandhurst</strong>, <strong>
	  Winnersh</strong> and <strong>Yateley</strong>, of every description and 
	  size consisting of attractive estates, residences, farms, extensive 
	  woodlands at Finchampstead, building land and licensed premises, the Drill 
	  Hall at Wokingham, the hotel at Wellington College and polo ground, 
	  numerous cottages, enclosures of pasture and accommodation land, &amp;c.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Of the 123 lots, some 11 or 12 of the 
	  properties had been disposed of by private treaty previous to the auction, 
	  thus leaving over 100 lots to be offered by auction during the three days' 
	  sale. Of these about 31 were sold at the auction, and negotiations are 
	  being carried on for the purchase by private treaty of other lots.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As a rule the biddings were not keen, except 
	  for the <strong>Wellington Hotel</strong> and the other licensed 
	  properties, as would-be purchasers of landed property are evidently 
	  deterred from buying owing to the present uncertain state of the property 
	  market and the feeling of uncertainty that exists as to what further 
	  burdens may be placed upon landed property – or how future legislation may 
	  still more seriously affect owners of property.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On the first day (Tuesday) out of the 38 
	  lots offered by Auction only 11 were disposed of. On the second day 
	  (Wednesday) 40 lots were submitted to auction and 16 were sold, while on 
	  Thursday, the last day, of the 35 lots offered only four were sold at the 
	  fall of the hammer.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The sale commenced each day at two o'clock, 
	  and was conducted by <strong>Mr. H. C. Trollope and Mr. James Baker</strong> 
	  (principals of the firm of Messrs. Trollope).</p>
	  <p class="auto-style3" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>FIRST DAY – 
	  TUESDAY.</strong></p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On Tuesday, when the proceedings commenced, 
	  the large Drill Hall was completely filled by persons interested in the 
	  sale. Lots 1 to 42 were entered on the list for the first day's sale but 
	  as four of the properties had been dealt with previously by private 
	  treaty, only 38 lots were offered; and of these only 11 were sold at the 
	  fall of the hammer, the reserve price for the other lots not having been 
	  reached.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. H. C. Trollope in his opening remarks 
	  said the various properties which would be offered were generally in very 
	  good order, the Walter family with almost princely liberality, having for 
	  many years past kept the estate in a state of excellent repair. After 
	  having referred to several prospective Parliamentary Measures which he 
	  thought would eventually benefit the land, Mr. Trollope said that broadly 
	  speaking, the outlook was a good one for tenants, and better times he 
	  hoped were now approaching.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The properties dealt with on the first day 
	  were mostly situated in <strong>Wokingham</strong>, <strong>Barkham</strong>,
	  <strong>Winnersh</strong> and <strong>Newlands</strong> [sic]. The eleven 
	  lots disposed of realised a total of £4,575, and were as follows:-</p>

	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The properties sold at the fall of the 
	  hammer on Wednesday were:-</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 43, comprising a freehold

	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 44 comprised a freehold

	  in the parish of <strong>Barkham</strong>, about half a mile from 
	  Arborfield Cross, with about 90 acres of pasture and arable land, and with 
	  the farm house let at £75 per annum. Included in this lot was also a 
	  13-acre arable field, let at £15 per annum. The timber on this lot was 
	  valued at £354; tithe £20 11s. This was purchased by <strong>Mr, Samuel 
	  Jeanes, of Swansea</strong>, for £1,570, in addition to the value of the 
	  timber.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 45, the freehold dwelling-house 
	  and shop known as Barkham Post Office</strong>, in the centre of the 
	  village, with garden of about a quarter acre, let at a rental of £25 per

	  Camberley</strong>, for £500.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 48 comprised the fully-licensed 
	  freehold country inn</strong> known as <strong>“The Old Leather Bottle”</strong>, 
	  about a mile from the town of Wokingham on the Barkham-road, with small 
	  garden, paddock and outbuildings about 1½ acres, and let at £32 per annum, 
	  and timber valued at £14, was purchased by <strong>Messrs. H. and G. 
	  Simonds, Ltd.</strong>, brewers, Reading, for £1,110.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 49, a freehold cottage with 
	  outbuildings and garden</strong>, situated in <strong>Evendon's-Lane</strong>, 
	  about a mile from Wokingham, let at £13 per annum, was sold to <strong>Mr. 
	  J. H. Ogburn, of Holyoak-road, Newington Butts</strong>, for £300. </p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 50, about 13 acres of freehold 
	  woodland</strong>, also in the parish of <strong>Wokingham Without</strong>, 
	  under a mile from Wellington College Station, with frontage of about 1,170 
	  feet to the Wellington road and about 750 feet to the Nine Mile Ride, was 
	  sold at the fall of the hammer to <strong>Mr. Poppy, of Hagville, 
	  Wokingham</strong>, at the extraordinarily low price of £170, which means 
	  only about £15 per acre for the land. But the growing timber on the lot 
	  was valued at £253, and had to be paid for in addition to the purchase 
	  money. Even then the price at which the 13 acres were sold averaged only 
	  about £33 per acre including the timber.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 60. - The adjacent 23 acres of 
	  freehold woodland</strong>, described as <strong>suitable for building 
	  development, in the parishes of Wokingham Without and Finchampstead</strong>, 
	  having a frontage of about 2,300 feet to the Wellington road, and an 
	  average depth of about 420 feet, was sold to the <strong>Wokingham 
	  Investment Company</strong> for £300, a remarkably low price considering 
	  that this land is within half a mile of Wellington College Station, the 
	  average being about only £15 per acre. But the timber on this lot had been 
	  valued at £279, and this amount had to be paid in addition to the purchase 
	  money, thus bringing up the average price to about £30 per acre.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 62 comprised the well-known 
	  Wellington Hotel</strong> with the adjacent land, close to Wellington 
	  College Station. The hotel is freehold and fully licensed, and has 
	  excellent accommodation, with a large annexe and extensive stabling and 
	  outbuildings, and cottages with gardens, about 2½ acres in extent, let at 
	  £137 per annum to <strong>Mr. James</strong>; also 11 acres of adjacent 
	  woodland, let at £2 15s. per annum, the whole occupying about 17 acres, 
	  with timber valued at £221. With this lot the <strong>freehold polo 
	  ground, tennis courts and croquet lawns</strong> immediately opposite the 
	  Wellington Hotel, covering an area of about 22 acres, and let to the 
	  tenant of the hotel at £40 per annum, were also included, the timber being 
	  valued at £15. After some spirited bidding the two lots (offered together) 
	  were sold to <strong>Mr. J. C. James, the tenant of the Wellington Hotel</strong>, 
	  for £8,300. </p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 65. - The freehold wood known as

	  with the timber valued at £332, was sold to <strong>Mr. Poppy</strong> for 
	  £275.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 66. - An enclosure of freehold 
	  woodland</strong>, also in the <strong>parish of Sandhurst</strong>, 
	  having a frontage of about 875 feet to the Sandhurst-road, and of about 
	  930 feet to the road leading to Finchampstead, comprising an area of some 
	  10 acres, was also sold to <strong>Mr. Poppy</strong> for £420. The timber 
	  on this site was valued at £147, to be paid for in addition to the 
	  purchase money.</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Lot 71. - Four freehold cottages and

	  about 7 acres in extent, let at a rental of £7 5s. per annum, with timber 
	  valued at £10, sold to <strong>Mr. John Over</strong> for £180.</p>

	  at £13 10s.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style3" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>THIRD DAY. -

	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There was again a good attendance at the 
	  Drill Hall on Thursday, when the third and concluding sale of this week's 
	  auction was conducted by Mr. Trollope and Mr. Baker. The result, however, 
	  was a very poor one, only four lots out of the 35 offered at auction being 
	  bought outright – and those at prices which must be considered distinctly 
	  satisfactory to purchasers. The following were the only lots knocked down 
	  in the room:-</p>

	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The following were the more important lots

		(Three cottages and

	  <strong>Colonel A. Jones, C.E., V.C.</strong>, of Ridge Cottage, 
		Finchampstead.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style7">

        Many years afterwards, in 1936, the 'Reading Mercury' carried an article 
		on 18th January on the purchase of Finchampstead Ridges by the National 
		Trust. A couple of months later, the following letter appeared in the 
		'Mercury':</p>
	  <p class="auto-style7">

        Letter: <strong>FINCHAMPSTEAD RIDGES</strong>.<br><br><em><strong>To the 
		Editor of the “Reading Mercury, Berks County Paper”</strong>.<br><br>
		Sir. - I find that the </em><strong><em>Finchampstead Ridges having been 
		given to the National Trust</em></strong><em> is not understood. It was 
		entirely due to the brain and energy of </em><strong><em>Colonel Jones, 
		V.C.</em></strong><em>, of Ridge Cottage, for, at that date, few, if 
		any, had heard of the </em><strong><em>National Trust</em></strong><em>. 
		It was Colonel Jones who collected subscriptions and arranged the 
		purchase from </em><strong><em>Mr. Walter</em></strong><em>, who acted 
		most liberally in the matter. </em>
        
  </p>
	  <p class="auto-style7">

        <em>Colonel Jones desired to secure the whole of the ridges, but he met 
		with so little support that, having collected the sum of £3,000, he 
		desisted from further work. I cannot obtain a list of subscribers, but I 
		have obtained from the family a full confirmation of the above facts. 
		Colonel Jones' position enabled him to get support in the county, where 
		he was well known. I hope you will kindly print this so that the real 
		facts may be known.<br><br>Yours truly, E. E. COPE, Finchampstead Place. 
		April 25th, 1936. </em>

	  the Board of Guardians for the <strong>'Cottage Homes'</strong> was 
	  completed by the end of 1912, as the following news item from the 'Reading 
	  Mercury' dated 14th December illustrates:</p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm" class="auto-style2"><strong>THE NEW COTTAGE 
	  HOMES AT WOKINGHAM.</strong></p>
	  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The formal opening for use of the Cottage 
	  Houses recently erected in the Oxford-road, Wokingham, by the Board of 
	  Guardians to accommodate children until then in the Workhouse, was on 
	  Tuesday afternoon, and the brief ceremony was a pleasant and interesting 
	  one. The Home, which is called <strong>“Murray House”</strong>, in 
	  compliment to the Chairman of the Guardians (<strong><a href="C20/families_Sturges.htm">Mr. 
	  Edward Murray Sturges</a></strong>) and cost £1,500, was designed by
	  <strong>Mr. A. C. Hughes</strong>, of The Ingle, Wokingham, and erected by 
	  the executors of the late <strong>Mr. J. B. Seward</strong>, of Wokingham. 
	  It is designed for eight boys and a like number of girls, and every 
	  accommodation, sanitary and otherwise, is provided for the children, as 
	  well as suitable quarters for the supervising “Mother”. <br><br>A large 
	  and representative gathering, including the Mayor and Mayoress (<strong><a href="C20/memories_Martins_Pool.htm">Mr. 
	  and Mrs. W. T. Martin</a></strong>) and most of the Guardians and 
	  officials of the Union accepted Mr Sturges' invitation to attend the 
	  ceremony; and heard from that gentleman a short and interesting account of 
	  the way in which the Wokingham Guardians had dealt with poor children in 
	  the past, and pointed out the advantages of the “Cottage Home” system over 
	  keeping young people in a workhouse, or of boarding them out, which had 
	  more recently been tried. He reminded his hearers that at one time the 
	  Wokingham and Reading Unions joined in the maintenance of a <strong>
	  “District School” at Wargrave</strong>, which, although it cost a good 
	  deal of money, was justified by its results; and he hoped that the same 
	  success would be obtained from the present cottage home.<br><br>The
	  <strong>Rev. B. Long</strong> (the new Chaplain to the Union) officiated 
	  for the first time, offering prayer, and afterwards Mr. Sturges 
	  entertained the party to tea. &nbsp;</p>
