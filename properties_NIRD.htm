        <p class="stbody">The first mention of the N.I.R.D. was in the 'Reading 
        Mercury' o<font size="2">f November 15th 1919, in a long article on <b>'The Research Institute 
in Dairying at Reading – Its Present Opportunity'</b>. The following article 
        came at the at the other end of the N.I.R.D.'s existence, and is an 
        extract from the N.I.R.D. Final report, 1984/5.</font></p>

        <p class="sthead"><font size="4">History of the National Institute for 
        Research in Dairying</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">The need for farm land at agricultural research 
        institutes is sometimes questioned. At the N.I.R.D. (National Institute for 
        Research in Dairying) it would have been possible to carry out research 
        on the physiology of lactation and ruminant nutrition with small numbers 
        of cows and relatively little land, but for a substantial programme of 
        applied research on milk production technology, large numbers of cattle 
        at the calf, rearing and lactation stages are essential.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">The move from <b>Reading</b> to <b>Shinfield</b> in 1920 provided 
        the Institute with <b>Church Farm</b>. This comprised 332 acres and some 
        traditional buildings which, with some inexpensive additions, allowed 
        the development of a Shorthorn herd of up to 60 cows. The need for 
        expansion of the farming activities became evident during the 1930's.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">In 1945 land was relatively inexpensive and was coming 
        on the market locally.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">The first purchase was <b>Arborfield Hall Farm in 1947</b> 
        (299 acres) and although this subsequently became the home of the 
        <b>Bernard Weitz Centre</b> with a new herd of 400 lactating cows, it was 
        originally bought to provide extra sources of home-grown forage crops and 
        to give grazing and housing for young stock. The farm is mainly situated 
        on Valley Gravel interspersed with London Clay and at the time of 
        purchase was in a low state of fertility. There were also signs of land 
        drainage problems. A modest programme of drain laying coupled with the 
        repair of </font> <b><a href="families_conroy.htm">
        <font face="Verdana, Tahoma,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, MS sans serif" size="2">Sir John Conroy's</font></a></b><font size="2"> land drainage system laid a century earlier 
        enabled most of the land to be ploughed and a cropping system developed. 
        It was found possible to build up fertility with lucerne and this, 
        together with subsequent introduction of forage maize, not only 
        increased greatly forage supply in the form of hay, silages and later 
        dried lucerne but also permitted the growing of good crops of barley.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">Some of Conroy's old buildings have been adapted for 
        cattle housing and part of the scrub land was cleared for cropping, but 
        most of the woodland, particularly that bordering the <b>River Loddon</b> and 
        the other boundaries of the farm, has been retained and there is an 
        annual programme of tree planting. Although the new cattle buildings are 
        utilitarian rather than beautiful, visitors to Arborfield Hall Farm 
        still appreciate its amenity value.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">At the time of purchase of Hall Farm the Institute 
        also took over the tenancy of about 73 acres of land between the River 
        Loddon and the village of Shinfield. This land was subsequently 
        purchased by the University of Reading. It provided for increased silage 
        production and was particularly useful for summer grazing since it is 
        low lying and some of it is more drought resistant than the land on the 
        Arborfield side of the Loddon. It was also convenient for irrigation 
        from the River Loddon.</font><a href="aerial/aerial_ref4042.htm"><font face="Verdana, Tahoma,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, MS sans serif" size="2"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Arborfield Hall Farm, Parrot Farm and the River Loddon in 1946" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Aerial/AC_ref_4042b.JPG" width="444" height="583"></font></a></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">After the purchase of Hall Farm, Arborfield, there 
        still existed a small farm, <b>Parrot Farm</b>, between the village of Shinfield and the River Loddon which was completely surrounded by 
        <b>Church 
        Farm, Shinfield</b>, and <b>Hall Farm, Arborfield</b>. It was not particularly good 
        land and a substantial part of it was at that time subject to regular 
        flooding from the river. Its potential value to the Institute was, 
        however, great since it was an obvious corridor between Church Farm and 
        Hall Farm.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"> <b><font size="2">Mr. Smith</font></b><font size="2">, the owner of 
        <b>Parrot Farm</b>, and his brother decided 
        to give up farming and to sell their farm. It consisted of 141 acres and 
        was bought by the Institute in <b>1961</b>.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><a href="C_H_1919.htm">
        <font face="Verdana, Tahoma,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, MS sans serif" size="2">Carters Hill Farm</font></a></b><font size="2"> of 268 acres was bought in 
        <b>1971</b>. One 
        main reason for acquiring this additional land was that the Institute's 
        work on the feeding of dairy cattle and also on the mechanics of dairy 
        farming would be much more effective if a larger up-to-date dairy cattle 
        unit was deve</font><a href="properties_carters_hill_farm_closeup.htm"><font face="Verdana, Tahoma,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, MS sans serif" size="2"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Carters Hill Farm as it was in 1944" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/Aerial/Carters_Hill_Farm2.jpg" width="501" height="351"></font></a><font size="2">loped and since this unit would require more land, its siting at Arborfield with easy access to the Carters Hill land was 
        appropriate. </font>  </p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">In the event, the developmenttt of the Bernard Weitz Centre 
        at Arborfield, close to the Carters Hill boundary, was dependent on the 
        Carters Hill land. </font>  </p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">The land at Carters Hill is mostly situated on Valley 
        Gravel with a relatively small area of riverside alluvium and as at 
        Arborfield and Shinfield good crops of maize and lucerne have been 
        produced.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">With the purchase of Carters Hill the Institute were 
        farming 1113 acres. As land was purchased estate work was necessary. The 
        gravel tracks through Arborfield Hall farm were replaced with concrete 
        roads but the main costs were those of land drainage and fencing. The 
        former was made possible by cooperation with Thames Conservancy in 
        clearing some of the traditional watercourses to the Loddon and although 
        some land is flooded in very wet weather the flood water normally clears 
        in 3 or 4 days without apparent damage. Most of Arborfield Hall Farm had 
        been tile drained by </font> <b><a href="families_conroy.htm">
        <font face="Verdana, Tahoma,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, MS sans serif" size="2">Sir John Conroy</font></a></b><font size="2"> in 1840-1850 and some of his drains 
        still operate but others had to be replaced or supported with new 
        drainage systems. The Institute will cease to exist on 31st March, 1985.
