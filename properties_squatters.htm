        September 1946:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>SQUATTERS "TAKE OVER" BARKHAM MANOR</b></p>
        <p align="center"><b>Former Offices Now House Eight Families</b></p>
        <p>In the early hours of Tuesday morning, three families of 
        ex-Serviceman moved into Barkham Manor. They were joined later by 
        another three families, and by Wednesday the premises were occupied by 
        eight families – all Barkham ex-Service men.</p>
        <p>[Photo – ‘A Group of the Squatters at Barkham Manor’]</p>
        <p>The first to take up occupation was <b>Mr. and Mrs. H. Smith</b>, 
        with their two children (aged 4 years and 18 months respectively), <b>
        Mr. and Mrs. E. Smith</b> and <b>Mr. and Mrs. Jones </b>and their two 
        children (aged 10 years and 2 years). They were later joined by <b>Mr. 
        and Mrs. Woods</b> and their 11-years-old daughter; <b>Mrs. Allen</b> 
        and her two children (aged 5 years and 8 months respectively); <b>Mr. 
        and Mrs. Bodd</b>y and her two children (aged 4 years and 2 years 
        respectively); and <b>Mr. and Mrs. Lillywhite </b>and their 14-years-old 
        daughter.</p>
        <p>In an interview with a "Times" reporter, Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones said 
        that they had no alternative other than to move into <b>Barkham Manor</b> 
        (which has been empty for nearly three years).</p>
        <p>All the families had been living in very overcrowded conditions and 
        Mrs. Boddy, with her two children had lived, slept and cooked in one 
        small room. They had all been on the council’s housing list for six 
        years.</p>
        <p>Barkham Manor was formerly used as offices, and a local estate 
        agent’s board on the gate announces the fact that it is to let. [With] 
        Twelve bedrooms, four reception rooms, six bathrooms, numerous box rooms 
        and a large kitchen, the house is equipped with electric light from a 
        private plant in the caretaker’s cottage, and main water is, we 
        understand, available. Most of the rooms have been furnished – sparsely, 
        but with the main essentials, and notices on the doors inform all and 
        sundry who are in residence. Cooking is accomplished in the fire grates 
        and on oil stoves.</p>
        <p>Our reporter was informed that the squatters have had visits from the 
        police and officials of the Rural District Council, and also from a 
        representative of the Berkshire War Agricultural Committee (who have the 
        house on a lease), and they were strongly advised to vacate the 
        premises. This, apparently, was not quite as simple as it would appear, 
        for all the families have left their former "residences" and would have 
        nowhere to go. Their plight is indeed serious, and they are all anxious 
        about their young children. They have decided to "stick", and as our 
        reported left, a deputation was on its way to the estate agents to 
        inquire whether the squatters can rent the premises.</p>
        <p>They had heard that the rent was about £10 per week, and if they 
        would be accepted as tenants, and accommodate two or more families, 
        their individual commitment would be a pound a week, which they would 
        all be glad to pay. It was observed that water was coming in the ceiling 
        in two or three of the rooms, and the squatters volunteered the 
        information that they were prepared to put the place in reasonable 
        repair and keep it clean. One of the families informed our reporter that 
        this was the first time they had lived in a house with a bathroom! </p>
        <p>[These families were evicted from Barkham Manor within a few months, 
        but were offered accommodation in huts at <b>
        <a href="properties_hall_squatters.htm">Arborfield Hall Camp</a></b>. 
        The <b>Lillywhite</b> family eventually moved into <b>Anderson Crescent</b>.]</p>

        <p align="center">From the ‘Times and Weekly News’&nbsp; - Friday August 
        30<sup>th</sup> 1946:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>"SQUATTERS" MOVE IN TO ARMY HUTS AT BRACKNELL AND 
        WARFIELD PARK</b></p>
        <p>Two vacant army camps in the Bracknell area were taken over by 
        "Squatters" during last week – the one known as <b>Westwick Camp in 
        Bagshot Road, Bracknell</b>, and the other at <b>Warfield Park</b>.</p>
        <p>[Photo: ‘Mr. and Mrs. Peters with two of their children, outside 
        their new home’]</p>
        <p>First to move into these one-time quarters of the Military Police 
        were <b>Mr. Winston</b>, who is a Thames Valley ‘bus conductor, his wife 
        and their 3-years’ old daughter, Iris.</p>
        <p>They have settled in the troops’ dining hall, while the adjoining 
        officers’ and sergeants’ messes have been put into use as bedrooms and 
        the cookhouse has become their kitchen.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Winston informed our reporter that, having decided to "settle" 
        in their new home, she had written to Easthampstead Rural District 
        Council acquainting them of the fact. Subsequently they had a visit from 
        the Surveyor and Sanitary Inspector to inspect the sanitation facilities 
        and, it is learned, their report has been submitted to the Ministry of 
        Health. Water is available and Mrs. Winston hopes that the electricity 
        supply will shortly be restored. </p>
        <p>In one or two instances, candles were being used but, in the words of 
        one of the young mothers, "It is nice to have somewhere of our own".</p>
        <p>Mr. Winston, an ex-Army man of 4 years’ service, was forced to seek 
        alternative accommodation, as his wife’s employment as housekeeper at 
        the house where they were formerly living, had ceased. </p>
        <p>During the afternoon of our representative’s visit, another arrival 
        was 25 year old Mrs. Wheeler, who promptly displayed on the door of Hut 
        No. 4 <b>"Occupied by Mrs. Wheeler from the Workhouse"</b>. Her husband, 
        she said, was working at a Public Assistance Institution in London, and 
        it was only possible for her to see him from 3 to 4 p.m. on Sunday 
        afternoons. After two months in an Institution, since her child was 
        born, Mrs. Wheeler was now more hopeful of the future, and hoped that 
        her husband would be able to get a job in this district. During the war 
        she was a nurse at a Maidenhead Hospital. Like most of the new home 
        seekers, Mr. Wheeler is an ex-Serviceman.</p>
        <p>At No. 2 our reporter chatted with <b>Mr. and Mrs. Peters</b>, who 
        had taken possession with three of her four children. Mr. Peters who has 
        served in the R.N. for twelve years and was invalided out in 1943, 
        related that they were comfortable and perhaps a little more fortunate 
        than some of their neighbours in that their new home possessed an open 
        fire-place as well as a stove.</p>
        <p>In practically every case the families had been living in overcrowded 
        conditions. And for most of the young people, it was the first time they 
        had had a place of their own.</p>
        <p>All the wooden huts and Nissen buildings at Warfield Park have now 
        been "taken over" by "squatters".</p>
        <p>The huts there are good wooden structures with concrete floors, and 
        the many buildings are linked by stone footways.</p>
        <p>First to move in was another <b>Mrs. Wheeler</b>, who brought her 
        furniture along from rooms at Haley Green. An ex-A.T.S. girl of 2½ 
        years’ service, she was assisting her husband to arrange the furniture, 
        while their three children appeared to be enjoying the scope of their 
        new quarters. The Wheelers, celebrating the tenth anniversary of their 
        wedding on that day, were quite satisfied after a long time in rooms. 
        Gas pipes are fitted to all the buildings and in the case of this family 
        they were able to have the advantage of gas light.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wheeler spent nine of his twelve Army years in foreign climes and 
        was twelve months a prisoner of war.</p>
        <p>Nearby, <b>Mrs. H. T. Higgs</b> was busy getting a home ready for her 
        ex-airman husband, and their two years seven months’ old son, Mervyn. 
        They had moved across from 9, Council Houses, Haley Green, and here 
        again it was a case of "the first home of our own".</p>
        <p>We understand that an instruction has been issued by an officer of 
        the War Department for both gas and water to be made available.</p>
        <p>An official of the <b>Easthampstead Rural District Council</b>, when 
        asked what was the position of these "settlers", stated that it was in 
        the hands of the Ministry of Health.</p>
        <p align="center">Also from the ‘Times and Weekly News’&nbsp; - Friday 
        August 30<sup>th</sup> 1946:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>"SQUATTERS" "TAKE OVER" BINFIELD PARISH ROOM.</b></p>
        <p>Squatting spread to beyond Army Camps on Sunday morning, when <b>Mr. 
        and Mrs. H. R. Hatfield</b>, with their 3 years’ old son David, decided 
        to accommodate themselves within the four walls of <b>Binfield’s Parish 
        Room</b>.</p>
        <p>After having notice to quit the rooms in which they had been living, 
        the Hatfields, with the aid of a pram, began moving in at 7 p.m., and 
        quickly settled in the building’s annex. Instead of wallpaper, neatly 
        lining the interior walls were books belonging to the Binfield Library, 
        and as if offering evidence of yet another ex-Serviceman without a home, 
        in the corner stood to overfull kit bags, one labelled "home service" 
        and the other "overseas".</p>
        <p><i>Note: There were many news articles on "Squatters" in the "Reading 
        Mercury" and "Reading Standard", which can be viewed on microfilm at 
        Reading Local Studies Library, and in the "Times and Weekly News", which 
        is on microfilm at Bracknell Local Studies Library.</i></p>
