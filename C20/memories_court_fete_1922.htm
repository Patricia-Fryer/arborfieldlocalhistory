Most fetes of the 1920's and 1930's were held either at Newlands or at 
Arborfield Hall. However, Arborfield Court is known to have hosted a fete in 
 
1922, as described in the 'Reading Mercury' of September 23rd 1922: <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">&nbsp;</span></b><p align="center">
<b><font size="3">ARBORFIELD FETE – Interesting Gathering at the Court</font></b></p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon the inhabitants of Arborfield, Newland and Barkham 
combined in an effort on behalf of church and school funds, and with efficient 
organisation and general enthusiasm the fete and sports arranged were carried 
through with<a href="../pictures_collier_A371.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Arborfield Court, from the Collier Collection." vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/Thumb/Collier/Collier_A371.jpg" width="252" height="173"></a> the zest necessary for the enjoyment of the large number of 
visitors. The function was held by kind permission of <b>Mr K L C Prescott</b>, 
of <b>Arborfield Court</b>, in grounds eminently suitable for the occasion. Mr Prescott 
also threw open the beautiful gardens of the Court to the visitors. </p>
<p>The main object for which funds are required is the repairing and 
redecorating of <b>Arborfield Church of England Schools</b>; any surplus will be handed 
to the Arborfield and Barkham parochial funds.</p>
<p>The weather on Tuesday was most unpromising, but happily Wednesday broke 
bright and warm, and throughout the day the conditions were delightful.</p>
<p>Ample entertainment and amusement was provided for the visitors, including a 
programme of sports, in which the humorous element predominated. Entries were 
capital, and both competitors and spectators entered whole-heartedly into the 
fun. The <b>Rev. J A Anderson</b> and <b>Major Morris</b> were the judges; the 
sports committee were <b>Messrs. Frank Bryant</b>, <b>H Empson</b>, <b>E Bowyer</b> 
and <b>A Parsons</b>. During the afternoon a capital concert was given in a 
large marquee, the artistes being <b>Mrs Giles Ayres</b>, <b>Miss Clutterbuck</b> 
(both of Reading) and <b>Major Morris</b>, whilst Morris and Country Dancing was 
prettily executed by scholars of Arborfield schools.</p>
<p>There were several well-stocked and attractively-arranged stalls, the vendors 
being as follows: - <br><br>Fancy stall, the <b>Misses Churcher</b> (2); <br>Rectors’ and 
churchwardens’ stall, <b>Mrs Prescott</b>, <b>Mrs Anderson</b> and <b>Mrs E 
Bowyer</b>; <br>Women’s Institute stall, <b>Miss Simonds</b> and assistants; <br>Barkham 
stall, <b>Mrs Ditchfield</b>, <b>Mrs Sturges</b>, <b>Mrs Shaw</b>, <b>Miss 
Garland</b>, <b>Miss Humphreys</b>, <b>Mrs Bone</b>, <b>Mrs Barker</b> and <b>
Mrs Harris</b>; <br>Bran tub, <b>Miss Fouracre </b>and <b>Miss Kitty Bowyer</b>; 
and<br>Hoopla, <b>Mrs Prescott</b> and assistants.</p>
<p>Refreshments were provided under the supervision of <b>Mrs Bentley</b>, who was 
assisted by <b>Mrs Bentley, jun.</b>, <b>Mrs Russ</b>, <b>Miss Edwards</b>, <b>Miss Garret</b>t, 
<b>Mrs Bishop</b>, 
<b>Miss Druitt</b> [sic], <b>Mrs Cox</b>, <b>Mrs Rogers</b>, <b>Miss Rogers</b>, 
<b>Miss Hayward</b> and <b>Mr Cox</b>. 
 
</p>
<p>Members of the committee were in charge of many amusing and competitive 
side-shows, including bowling for a pig and ham, kicking the football, bowling, 
quoits, etc.  </p>
<p>A baby show was arranged, and for this <b>Dr G Halpin</b> was the judge, 
being assisted by <b>Miss Skinner</b> and <b>Mrs Pantin</b>. For the younger visitors swinging 
boats, roundabouts, etc., were provided.</p>
<p>The <b>Rev. J A Anderson</b> was the chairman of the committee responsible for the 
general arrangements, whilst the onerous duties of hon. Secretary were ably 
carried out by <b>Mr W J Verrall</b>. The committee consisted of <b>Messrs. Jones</b>, 
<b>Pope</b>, 
<b>Kent</b>, <b>Parsons</b>, <b>W Cox</b>, <b>Middleton</b>, <b>Seymour</b>, <b>Barnes, sen. and jun.</b>, 
<b>Watts</b>, <b>Clark</b>, <b>Petts</b>, <b>Empson</b>, <b>Grant</b>, <b>Garrett</b>,

<b>Harris</b>, <b>Humphreys</b>, <b>L Ruffell</b>, <b>E Cox</b>, <b>G Russ</b>,
<b>Mattingley</b>, <b>Ward</b> and <b>Bayliss</b>.</p>
<p>At night a dance was promoted at the schools, when the attendance was good. 
<b>Mr Frank Bryant</b> was the M. C., and capital dance music was provided by <b>Mrs 
Bryant</b> and <b>Miss Kitty Edwards</b>.</p>
