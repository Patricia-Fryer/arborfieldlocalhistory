The award of the Distinguished Flying Medal has been made to 1167722 <b>Sergeant 
Kenneth George Elcoate</b>, no. 148 Squadron. This airman has taken part in 
operations against Germany in the Western Desert, Greece, Crete and Sicily. One 
night in June, 1942, he was captain of one of the bombers detailed to drop 
flares on Banghazi [sic] to provide illumination for an attack on the port by 
heavy bombers. Despite most intensive defensive fire, Sergeant Elcoate succeeded 
in his mission, and thereby contributed much to the great success achieved by 
the bombing force.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sergeant Elcoate was born in 1916 at 
Aston, Oxon. His home is “The Withers”, Arborfield, Berks. He was a clerk before 
enlisting in 1940.</span></p>

Officer Henry Roland Joseph Watts</b>, of H.M.S. Urge. The official citation states:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">“Petty Officer Watts served as a Torpedo 
Gunner’s Mate for a year while H.M.S. Urge was operating in the Mediterranean 
waters. In charge of the main armament, he carried out his duties with the 
utmost zeal and devotion. He showed unflinching steadiness and cheerfulness in 
adversity and his fine conduct and good example contributed much to the many 
successes of the ship.”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mrs. Watts has also had the misfortune 
to lose another son, <b>S. H. Watts, Coldstream Guards</b>, who was killed in 
the Libyan dessert [sic]. Writing of him, his company commander says:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">“He was one of the bravest men I have

seemed completely without fear. He would work on cheerfully throughout the most
