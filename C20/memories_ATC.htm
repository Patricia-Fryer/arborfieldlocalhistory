      <p>Martin's Pool in Wokingham was a well-known local attraction for 
      Arborfield folk, and its closure in the 1990s was much lamented. Many 
      local children learned to swim there.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The 'Reading Mercury' of&nbsp;19<sup>th</sup> May 1934 carried a photo 
      of the new pool, with the following caption:</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><em>"A glimpse showing the

      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">The new swimming pool which 
      has been constructed at “Fernleigh”, Wokingham, by Ald. W. T. Martin and 
      his son, Mr. Cathrow Martin, was officially opened on Saturday, in the 
      presence of a large company. These included the Mayor of Wokingham (the 
      Rev. C. Mansfield), Lady Victoria Villiers, Ald. P. Sale, Mr. W. M. 
      Colebrook, General Grant Wilkinson, Captain Evans, Mr. E. S. Whaley, 
      Alderman A. F. Clark (Reading), Mr. L. L. Rogers, Mr. and Mrs. F. E. 
      Chapman, Dr. Ward, Dr. Curl, Alderman M. Blake, the Rev. A. P. Carr, the 
      Rev. G. Kenworthy, the Rev. T. W. Sergeant, Mrs. Pigott, Mr. A. T. Heelas, 
      Mr. C. Goddard, Supt. Butler, Mr. Elliston Clifton, Mr. C. W. Marks, 
      etc.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">Alderman W. T. Martin, in 
      introducing the Mayor, said for over thirty years he had been trying his 
      utmost to get a swimming pool for the Borough of Wokingham. When he went 
      on the council 34 years ago it was one of the planks in his election 
      address that they should try to do something to teach the children to 
      swim. They had gone on from year to year, but all their schemes had fallen 
      through. So he had now endeavoured to find something off his own bat. He 
      hoped they had succeeded in producing a bathing place acceptable to all. 
      (Applause). They had taken a good deal of trouble to find out the very 
      best. They had the purest water for them to bathe in, so that they could 
      come there and feel absolutely safe. They had adopted one of the finest 
      water purifiers they were able to find. The whole of the designs had been 
      got out by his son. (Applause). They had found a very able man as 
      contractor in Mr. Barrett, who had spared no efforts to carry out to the 
      last letter everything so that they would have a swimming pool that would 
      be hard to surpass. Through the construction of the pool they were able to 
      find work for a large number of men, who had worked willingly. They had 
      put their backs into the job, and no hours had been too long in order to 
      get it finished by that day. He felt very proud of the whole of the 
      workmen who had been engaged on the job. (Hear, hear).</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">1,100 TONS EXCAVATED.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">Mr. F. J. Barrett, the 
      contractor, expressed his thanks to Alderman Martin for giving such a 
      swimming pool to Wokingham. He was very proud of the job, and he thought 
      he had some reason to be. He also thanked Mr. Cathrow Martin for his 
      designing of the pool, which had made his work look so much better, and 
      for the very happy way in which they had been able to work together. He 
      also desired to thank his own employees for the good work they had put 
      into the job and the goodwill with which they had carried it out. They had 
      worked long hours to get the job completed, so that at two o'clock that 
      day he was able to say that the job was finished. </p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">Actually 1,100 tons of soil 
      had been excavated, and although they could not see it, this was still in 
      the garden. This was due to Mr. Martin's excellent designing. The amount 
      of shingle, sand and gravel used was 650 tons. Other quantities included 
      116 tons of cement and twelve tons of reinforcements. If the electrician's 
      wire used was measured it would probably amount to the same mileage as 
      that which they had covered in running round looking at various swimming 
      pools in the country.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">Mr. Barrett then presented Mr. 
      Martin with an inscribed silver-mounted ebony walking stick on behalf of 
      himself and the workmen. Mrs. Martin was handed a bouquet of 
      carnations.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><b>A Man of 
Enterprise.</b></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">The Mayor of Wokingham said 
      the idea of a swimming pool had been a pet scheme of Alderman Martin's for 
      many years, and as he could not get the council to spend the money to put 
      the matter in hand, he had, with great enterprise, undertaken the work 
      himself. (Applause). Alderman Martin was a man who had the best interests 
      of the town of Wokingham at heart, and they now saw one of the results of 
      that interest. They had a contractor in Mr. Barrett who had put his whole 
      heart into the job, and it was due to his energy and good management that 
      the pool was ready to be opened that day. The workmen, too, had carried 
      out their job well. In designing such a pretty pool, Mr. Cathrow Martin 
      had done excellent work. He hoped the whole town and, indeed, the 
      neighbourhood, would take advantage of this provision for the health and 
      welfare of the district. The best sign of their gratitude would be for 
      them to make as much use of the swimming pool as they possibly could.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">On behalf of Ald. Martin the 
      Mayor then presented a packet of money to each of the workmen.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">The opening ceremony was 
      followed by a swimming display. The opening splash was given by lady 
      members of the Reading Swimming Club, and this was followed by a diving 
      display by Miss L. L. Cullum (champion of Hampshire) and Miss M. Cullum. 
      Exhibitions of various strokes were given by Mr. S. Bell (Windsor Swimming 
      Club), ex-champion of England, Miss J. Edminson (Reading Swimming Club), 
      champion of Berks, and Miss L. L. Cullum. Polo matches were played between 
      Reading ladies and Hounslow ladies, and Reading men and Windsor men. The 
      display concluded with an aquatic exhibition by members of the Reading 
      Swimming Club, and by the Four Lucratics of the Highgate Swimming 
Club.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">The swimming pool is 110 feet 
      long, 40 feet wide, and 9 feet deep at its greatest depth. The water at 
      one end falls over a glass cascade, which is illuminated from underneath. 
      It then runs down a series of stone steps into the pool. Underwater 
      lighting has been provided for the pool itself, so that no lights will be 
      apparent to the eyes. The swimming pool is constructed of concrete, with a 
      snowcrete facing, which gives it a pure white appearance. At the end of 
      the pool opposite to the steps is a Venetian bridge, with three diving 
      boards, two six feet and one twelve feet in height. In addition to the 
      main swimming pool, there is a circular pool, 2ft. 6 in. deep, for the 
      children. This pool has its own illuminated cascade.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">The pools are in charge of 
      ex-Chief Petty Officer W. Gunnee, R.N., who has been instructor to the 
      Royal Navy at Portsmouth for twelve years. He is the holder of the bronze 
      medallion and bar, and the sword of merit of the Royal Life Saving 
      Society, of which he is a first-class instructor and examiner. </p>

      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">As teenagers in the 1940s my 
      friends and I visited this great outdoor swimming pool on many occasions. 
      My friends were the swimmers; I just put my swim suit on just to get wet, 
      did a bit of paddling around the edge, hanging on to the hand-rail in 
      fear. I enjoyed watching people diving off the boards into the pool with a 
      mighty splash and then surfacing; to me it was just magic.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">Apart from the main pool there 
      was a small paddling pool for the tiny children. Also, the lawns and 
      gardens were a perfectly lovely place to relax in.</p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">There was a drowning of a 
      local lad from Anderson Crescent. He went swimming at lunch times from his 
      place of work. I don't know what happened to cause his drowning. At this 
      time in the 1950s I was in a sanatorium and didn't get any other 
      information – only that he drowned. </p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western"><br></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western">I was saddened when Martin's 
      closed. </p>
