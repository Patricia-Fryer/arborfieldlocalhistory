<p>We have a first-hand account of <a href="memories_LHRS_9.htm"><b>local life 
during WWII by</b> <b>Burley Ridler</b></a>, 
although he didn't record the events until the early 1950s, under the <b><a href="memories_LHRS.htm">Local History Recording Scheme</a></b>. </p>
<p>
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="A wartime edition of the 'Reading Mercury and Oxford Gazette'" vspace    =5 align=left src="../images/new/reading_mercury.jpg" width=158 height=197 >Local 
newspapers gave us a different perspective, because they recorded the events as they happened 
(sometimes under the cloak of 
anonymity - but everyone knew, for example, that a '<b>local Technical School</b>' was at <b>Arborfield 
Garrison</b>). </p>
<p>Most of the small news items documenting <b>
<a href="memories_WWII_fund_raising.htm">every last Whist Drive</a></b> were 
in the <b>'Reading Mercury'</b>, but others did appear in the <b>'Reading Standard'</b> and the <b>'Berkshire Chronicle'</b> 
(all on microfilm at <b>Reading Local Studies Library</b>), and <b>'Times and 
Weekly News'</b> (on microfilm at <b>Bracknell Reference Library</b>).</p>
<p>The story really began around <b>1937</b> when it was announced that the old <b>
<a href="memories_Remount_Depot_Closure.htm">Remount Depot, a </a></b><font size="2">
<a href="../pictures_collier_A519.htm">
<img border="1" hspace="5" alt="The Moat House, built for the Remount Depot in 1906, has survived to the 21st Century" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/Collier/TN/Collier_A519.jpg" width="252" height="172"></a></font><b><a href="memories_Remount_Depot_Closure.htm">major 
local employer, was slated for closure</a></b> amid great 
fears for the local economy. </p>
<p>At the same time, local councils were actively 
preparing for war; <b>Reading Borough Council </b>and <b>Berkshire County Council</b> 
appointed their <b>Air Raid Precautions (A.R.P.) Officers </b>by late April. </p>
<p>Local news embraced <b>'Ambulances for the Spanish Civil War'</b>, donated by 
Reading townsfolk. </p>
<p>The first newspapers of 1938 reported on progress with <b>air-raid precautions</b>, 
with ditches being dug and shelters erected in and around Reading. In 
Arborfield, the Remount Depot had been renamed the <b>Ordnance Depot</b>, and 
wooden huts were being erected behind the entrance on what is now <b>Sheerlands 
Road</b>. The daughter of an employee at the Ordnance Depot,
<a href="families_Joan_Barker.htm"><b>10-year-old</b> <b>Joan Barker</b></a>, 
died after a short illness, and the local paper reported that her fellow pupils 
lined the pathway to the church at her funeral, each carrying a bunch of 
flowers.</p>
<p>On April 1st 
1939, the 'Mercury' announced plans for a simulated air raid, with a <b>
<a href="memories_black_out_exercise.htm">'Black-Out exercise' to be held from midnight on Saturday May 6th to 3 a.m. on 
Sunday May 7th</a></b>. The 'Mercury' reported on the results of the simulation in 
the Reading area, while the 'Times and Weekly News' went into some detail on 
what happened in and around Wokingham.<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Militiamen at Arborfield, July 1939 - copyright 'Mercury' photo used by permission" vspace  =5 align=right src="../images/new/militia_2a.jpg" width=264 height=191 ></p>
<p>While most of the village was not yet on mains electricity or water, the <b>
<a href="memories_Army_Tech_School_1939.htm">Army Technical School </a></b>was 
being equipped with all modern conveniences. </p>
<p>During 1939, the <b>Ordnance Depot</b> site was rapidly developed to 
accommodate <b><a href="memories_Militia_Camp_1939.htm">Militia men who had been 
called up for 6 months' service</a></b>, and some complained of the conditions 
around the camp, in particular the over-crowded and expensive bus service to 
Reading. </p>
<p>The war claimed its first casualty in Arborfield just a week after 
hostilities commenced, when a soldier was <b>
<a href="memories_blackout_bus_1939.htm">run over and killed by a bus</a></b> in 
blackout conditions outside <b>Duck's Nest Farm</b>. The black-out helped to 
cause another fatal injury in April the following year when poor <b>
<a href="memories_blackout_car_1940.htm">William Morland</a></b> was killed.</p>
<p><a href="memories_Inglis_wedding_1939.htm">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Mary Inglis and Gordon Stead, both in Army uniform." vspace  =5 align=left src="../images/new/inglis_wedding_tn.jpg" width=113 height=149 ></a>Among the weddings reported in the local press in 1939, two were 
slightly out of the 
ordinary: </p>
<p>It was common at the time for the <b>bridegroom</b> to marry in uniform, but 
both <b>
<a href="memories_Inglis_wedding_1939.htm">Mary Inglis and her husband Gordon 
Stead</a></b> (pictured left) wore military uniform.</p>
<p>In a first for Arborfield, <b><a href="memories_sa_wedding_1939.htm">Freda 
Devereux</a></b> wore <b>Salvation Army</b> uniform, marrying at 
the <b>Salvation Army Hall</b> in Arborfield.</p>
<p>The <b>Royal Merchant Navy School</b>, at the northern end of the parish at 
the Bearwood mansion, was often in the news. School activities stepped up a gear in 1938 when 
the part-time chaplain, the Bearwood Rector <b><a href="families_Bayley.htm">
Rev. Bayley</a></b>, was replaced by a full-time chaplain (though Rev. Bayley remained as 
Rector for some years). At the <b><a href="memories_RMNS_WWII.htm">1939 Speech 
Day</a></b>, the Resident Governor pointed out: <span lang="EN-GB"><b><i>“The 
general public do not yet appear to realise their debt to the fathers of these 
children, and to others of our merchant navy officers and men”</i></b>. Bearwood 
was connected with Arborfield parishioners on Remembrance Sunday, 1939, when the 
British Legion branch for Arborfield, Barkham and Bearwood paraded there. The 
following year, many of the same people were in the Home Guard, and paraded to 
the Chapel in the R.M.N.S. at Bearwood.</span></p>
<p><a href="memories_Home_Guard.htm">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The 11th Berks Battalion of the Home Guard meeting at Winnersh" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/new/HG_11th_Berks_Battn_2.jpg" width="349" height="211"></a></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb">The <b><a href="memories_Home_Guard.htm">Home Guard and 
the Royal Observer Corps</a></b> were very active in Arborfield during the war, 
but the only news items were Remembrance Sundays and socials, and the final 
stand-down in December 1944. The members continued to meet during 1945 as the <b>
'Newland (H.G.) Rifle Club'</b>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb">The newspapers noted a fair number of <b>
<a href="memories_WWII_offenders.htm">thefts at the Garrison</a></b>, as well as 
other misdemeanours.</span></p>
<p><b><a href="memories_Garth_WWII.htm">Hunting continued</a></b> during the 
war, but it appears that the choice of venues was more restricted. There don't 
seem to have been any meetings based on the 'Bramshill Hunt' P.H., where the 
road would have been too busy with Army lorries. Instead, the local meetings 
seemed to start at the <b>'Mole' Inn</b>. which of course had close links with 
nearby <b>Newlands Mansion</b>. 
Riders were warned to be careful not to trample on growing crops.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, villagers made extra efforts <b><a href="memories_DPK.htm">to grow 
their own vegetables and keep livestock</a></b>, with considerable success. 
Pupils from Arborfield School had their own allotment, and also helped in the 
gardens of those in the village whose men-folk were in the Services. They kept 
fit in other ways, and in the 1944-45 <b><a href="sport_in_WWII.htm">football</a></b> 
season won many matches.</p>
<p>Although the School wasn't subject to the overcrowding of several Reading 
schools that shared their buildings with evacuees, its facilities were used to 
the full. For some reason, the <b>Evening Institute</b> had been moved to <b>Three 
Mile Cross</b> in the late 1930's, but it was moved back in 1942, along with a new 
Flight of the <b><a href="memories_ATC.htm">Air Training Corps</a></b>. By 1944, 
this initiative had resulted in <span lang="EN-GB"><b>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">six cadets joining the Air Force as members of 
aircrew or ground staff. There were other regular </span>
<a href="memories_school_in_WWII.htm">news items about the school</a><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
throughout the war.</span></b></span></p>
<p>Despite the lack of space, the newspapers showed photos and carried small 
news items on local people in the <b><a href="memories_armed_forces.htm">Armed 
Forces</a></b>. Some won awards; others were taken prisoner, wounded, killed or 
missing. By 1943, some Prisoners of War were being repatriated among much 
celebration; one had to wait until the end of 1945.</p>
<p>Apart from the deaths of their loved ones on active services, there were some 
tragic incidents in the village. In February 1941, toddler <b>
<a href="families_Ruby_Barker.htm">Ruby Barker</a></b> was killed when a candle 
in her bedroom set light to the furniture. Another baby was involved in an 
accident outside the village shop in 1944; although the baby was unscathed, her 
mother, 22-year-old <b><a href="memories_LHD_Lorries.htm">Mrs. Muir</a></b>, 
later died in hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Despite the lack of space, the newspapers still managed to report the more 
timely <b><a href="memories_WWII_deaths.htm">deaths</a></b> of older residents, 
and to celebrate the <b><a href="memories_WWII_weddings.htm">weddings</a></b>, 
mostly with the bridegroom in uniform. <b><a href="memories_WWII_notices.htm">
Public notices</a></b> tended to appear on the front pages, while less official 
exhortations appeared in <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">advertisements</span></b> 
inside the newspapers.</p>
<p>The newspapers were very careful not to give any detail about bombing raids, 
because this information would have been useful to the enemy. However, the 
locations were sometimes published months later, or after V. E. Day. By June 
1945, the <b>Berkshire County A.R.P. Officer</b> was able to give detailed a <b>
<a href="memories_bombs.htm">detailed breakdown of bomb attacks </a></b>by type 
of bomb, year, and location.</p>
<p>A month before war ended in Europe, the 'Mercury' of March 31st reported 
optimistically: </p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"> 
<i>'At the annual meeting of the <b>Arborfield Parish Council</b>, the chairman,
<b>Mr. A. H. 
Capper</b>, spoke of <b>post-war developments</b> in the village in <b>housing</b>, 
<b>lighting</b>, 
<b>drainage</b>, etc. <br>He understood that <b>electrification</b> would be 
possible almost immediately after the war'</i>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb">However, it 
took several years for these mooted developments to become reality. In the 
meantime, returning soldiers and their families couldn't wait for new houses, so 
many old Army camps and requisitioned buildings, including <b>
<a href="../properties_hall_squatters.htm">Arborfield Hall</a></b>, were 
occupied by <b><a href="../properties_squatters.htm">"Squatters"</a></b>.</span></p>
