<p class="sthead"><font size="4">THE WOODEN CHAPEL ( - 1256)</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><br>
The old “Wooden Chapel of Edburgefeld”, not dedicated but named St. Bartholomew, 
and dependent on the Church of Sonning, from where it received oil and chrism 
(consecrated oil), was first mentioned in the Salisbury Diocesan Record of 1220.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">It was built of wood and although a good list of books and 
ornaments was found there, the building is described “to be in a disgracefully 
ruinous state and shamefully desecrated.” The churchyard was over-run with 
cattle and uprooted by pigs. The Salisbury Diocesan Record adds that the aged 
priest of Edburgefeld, who lived at the Manor House with Richard Bulloc “could 
not render a single sentence of the Canon or the Gospels correctly” owing to 
partial blindness.<br>
“Reginald” chaplain of Arborfield was also another, who at the same visitation 
by the Dean of Salisbury, was found to be most illiterate and ignorant.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">In 1224 the Chapel seems to have been in the charge of Priest 
John of Barkham, who was remiss in the oversight of his subordinates and the 
care of the Chapel. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The Chapel was in the grounds of the manor and close to the 
river Loddon.<br>

<p class="sthead"><font size="4">1256 THE CHURCH IS REBUILT</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">It is highly probable that the old church owes its erection to 
a former lord of the manor, as it was built close to the Manor House, an 
appended chapel to the Parish Church of Sonning.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">It was most likely built of chalk and flint in 1256, with a 
wooden tower and spire to the west-end, the church was added to in 1631. 
Portions of each can still be seen, though only a few walls are standing.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><br>
From the various sources that have been traced, we attempt to describe the 
church as it was:<br>
<br>
<i>The chancel was 9ft by 24ft wide; the nave 58ft by 28ft and had a tiled roof 
with wooden trusses. The chancel was raised two steps above the floor. There 
were two windows on the South side, with a door in the centre of the wall. This 
picture from an old watercolour shows the building as it was in 1818.</i></p>

<p class="stbody">When the building was pulled down in 1862, the chapel to the 
right was rebuilt as the <b><a href="families_conroy_chapel.htm">'Conroy Chapel'</a></b> with an arched East Window instead of 
the simple rectangle as shown here. The doorway on the South Wall can still be 
made out in the remains of the wall, now reduced to only a couple of feet above 
ground level. </p>

        ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 8th 1855,

  <p class="stbody">
        Present: the Rev’d Sir John Warren Hayes, Bart., rector, Arthur Pott, 
        curate, 2 churchwardens. The church in a very bad condition. The roof 
        apparently in a state of decay. Directed it to be examined by opening it 
        in several places. The font, a wooden one, but lined with lead and a 
        pewter basin within. Directed the basin to be disused and a drain made. 
        Ordered table of prohibited degrees to be put in a conspicuous place.<br>
        <br>
        There is a mortuary aisle belonging to the estate, late Sir J. Conroy’s. 
        The proprietors have lately divided it into two and set up a high 
        partition with a still higher lattice thereupon between the divisions.<br>

  <p class="stbody">
        <br>
        The following was written down from memory by Sir John Conroy, 3rd 
        baronet, in May 1869. It gives a short account of some paintings which 
        formerly existed in the old church, and which, after being hidden for a 
        long period, became visible after the disused church had been un-roofed 
        and allowed to become a ruin. <br>
        The words and copy of the illustrations (not reproduced here) are Sir 
        John’s own.<br>
        <br>
        “I found that only the East wall, and portions of the North, South and 
        West walls were standing. With the exception of the West wall (which had 
        been the wall of the tower), all the masonry bore traces of having been 
        painted in fresco, - the paintings had been plastered and white washed 
        over; where the covering had peeled off the remains of the paintings 
        were tolerably distinct. The plaster on the West wall was perfect, and 
        as I did not attempt to remove any portion of it, I cannot say whether 
        that wall had ever been painted on.<br>
        <br>
        E<br>
        <br>
        N S<br>
        <br>
        W<br>
        <br>
        A - East window<br>
        B - Doorway (modern?) <br>
        C - Doorway<br>
        <br>
        I found that a great portion of the church was built of hard chalk, the 
        jambs of the doorway at C being formed of the material, as also were the 
        jambs of the East window (A). At D there were painted figures (say three 
        and a half feet high), each figure under a painted canopy.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The one nearest the window represented an “ecclesiastic”, or at least a 
        person in ecclesiastical dress; the painting was much injured from 
        having been exposed to the weather foe sometime, and it was almost 
        impossible to distinguish the dress accurately, for with the exception 
        of the mitre (which was of the low triangular shape), the outlines had 
        been destroyed by damp; however the figures appeared to be vertical, 
        with yellowish stripes.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The next figure, for there were two under the middle canopy, were of a 
        woman and child, the child being represented as of about 13 or 14 years 
        old. They were both dressed in brownish drapery. The figures could 
        represent St. Nicholas and his mother.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The third figure was again of an ecclesiastic, appearing similar in all 
        aspects to the figure first mentioned, with this portion of the wall 
        having suffered more from damp, the painting was more indistinct. Above 
        these figures, the wall had been painted with reddish brown paint, to 
        represent stones, with a little ornament in the centre of each stone.<br>
        <br>
        Below the figures there was a large circular ring (about one and a half 
        feet in diameter) painted on the wall, with the same coloured paint. On 
        the opposite, or north side of the window, the plaster had only been 
        removed in a few spots, but the paintings there seemed of a similar 
        character.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        On the South and North walls, there were remains of painted drapery 
        (also of the same reddish brown colour), the drapery being two feet 
        wide, commencing about two feet to two and a half feet above the level 
        of the ground, and above the drapery some kind of geometrical pattern 
        appears to have been painted upon the wall, only slight traces were 
        visible. This decoration appears along both the North and South walls of 
        the church.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        About the spot F, near where the pulpit had to stand, the remains of a 
        piscina (a stone basin near the altar in Roman Catholic and 
        pre-Reformation churches for draining water used in the Mass) were 
        visible; a plain semi-circular arch had apparently existed, but the 
        greater portion of this had been destroyed; and thus there only remained 
        a portion and the hallowed stone of the piscina, which was rather oblong 
        without any kind of ornament and was formed of sandstone.<br>
        Between D and B there were also the remains of a small arch, similar to 
        that of the piscina, but that was the only portion remaining of which 
        had probably been a credence, (a small side table, shelf or niche which 
        holds the elements of the Eucharist before they are consecrated), for 
        Cordery (the local builder), had said that they had found no remains of 
        a drain: he also said that they had found remains of three stone seats 
        between D and F, the sedilia (three stone seats for priests in the South 
        wall of a chancel, often canopied and decorated), and he also added that 
        all the woodwork of the roof had been painted.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        I observed three encaustic tiles, the ground being of a dirty red and 
        the pattern formed of buff and black, each tile however containing a 
        portion of the pattern, it was not possible to get much idea of what 
        sort of a thing it had originally been, but apparently it had consisted 
        mainly of circles with a kind of flower shaped ornament in the middle.<br>
        <br>
        On one of the blocks of chalk forming the jambs of the door at C, a 
        pattern of this shape had been cut about 2 inches in diameter, over the 
        East window, a smaller opening had formerly existed, apparently in the 
        shape of a trefoil (a three lobed ornamentation, especially in tracery 
        windows). </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i>In 2004, a couple of tiny patches of paint were still visible on the 
        surrounds of the East Window.</i></p>

  <p class="stbody">
        Extract taken from “The Conroy Papers”:</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i>The Records in the Augmentation Office have been diligently searched 
        but afford no material information whatever respecting this Church. The 
        Parish of Arborfield does not occur in the Taxation of Pope Nicholas the 
        Fourth made AD 1291. neither among the Spiritualties nor, Temporalties 
        for which reason it may be presumed that the Parish is of more recent 
        erection. This is somewhat unfortunate as owing to this circumstance, 
        there will be no return of it, in a Survey made not many years 
        afterwards entitled the Nona Roll, which Survey in many instances has 
        been found to give not only an account of the quantity of the Glebe 
        Land, but a description of the specific Tithes due to the Incumbent. 
        Arborfield is an ecclesiastical Rectory and no Endowment is extant, 
        which would most probably have been discoverable, had it been a 
        Vicarage.</i></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i>The general ecclesiastical Survey taken in pursuance of an Act of 
        Parliament edited in the twenty sixth year of Henry the Eighth, affords 
        but little information. It appears from thence, that it was then of the 
        yearly value of eight pounds, but whether that Amount arose from Tithes 
        or from Glebe Land is not set forth (as it is believed) in the Records. 
        In this Case, unless any Terriers should chance to be in existence, it 
        does not seem that any light can be derived from ancient Records. The 
        proper Repositories for Terriers are the Places following: Viz.</i></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i>The Bishop’s Registry<br>
        The Archdeacon’s Registry<br>
        The Church Chest<br>
        <br>
        Arborfield seems to have been for a considerable Time connected with the 
        Deanery of Sarum, so far at least that the Dean has *peculiar 
        Jurisdiction there, but the two last Presentations seem to have been by 
        Elizabeth Waterman 1739 Richard Hayes Esquire 1755. by an Estimate made 
        in the last Century the Value of it annually was stated to be sixty 
        pounds. </i></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i>In addition to what has been stated as to the probability of there being 
        Terriers of this Rectory in existence it may be mentioned that there was 
        an ecclesiastical Survey taken of Church Benefices during the Usurpation 
        of Oliver Cromwell, which Survey is lodged in the Library of the 
        Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth, and which is sometimes found to 
        contain an Account of the Glebe Lands, Tithes and other Dues of the 
        Benefice so surveyed, It does not appear as far as can be judged by 
        inspection of the Records in the Augmentation Office and various other 
        Repositories that either the Church or any Lands within the Parish ever 
        belonged to any Monastery so as to be entitled to any priviledges in 
        that respect.</i></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i>Arborfield seems to be a small and obscure Parish of which very 
        little mention is made in Records of Antiquity, Mr. Caley having 
        searched for it not only in many Repertoires and Calendars in his own 
        possession but also in the several Catalogues to the Muniments contained 
        in the British Museum, without meeting with any reference to it. It need 
        hardly be mentioned that the Incumbent of this Church being an 
        ecclesiastical Rector, is entitled of common Right to all Tithes as well 
        great and small within the Parish, upon mere proof of Institution and 
        Induction, not so with respect to Glebe Land, for there he must either 
        shew actual Usage, or Evidence of antecedent Usage from Surveys or 
        Terriers, it therefore would have been highly desirable to have met with 
        such Documents. <br>
        <br>
        *Mr Caley’s Observations respecting the Living of Arborfield, in the 
        County of Berkshire<br>
        <br>
        Elias Ashmole the antiquarian, prior to his death in 1692 visited 
        Arborfield and Barkham and gives a meagre account of them informs us 
        that the <b>Rev’d John Sale</b> was Incumbent of the two Livings of Arborfield 
        and Barkham, to which livings he had been probably presented by the 
        <b>Standen</b> family who at that time were lords of these two manors, whereof 
        they sold Barkham in 16.. (1700) to a <b>Mr. Waterman of London</b>, who was 
        (says Ashmole) Lord of the manor of Barkham, and Patron of the living, 
        having purchased them from the Standens.</i></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i>The <b>Rev’d John Sale</b> incumbent of both Parishes, died 1739 - when it 
        would appear that <b>Mrs. Elizabeth Waterman</b> - (Widow of the Mr. Waterman 
        mentioned) made the next two Presentations to Arborfield, which Manor 
        was not in the Waterman’s domain, but which after the last male Heir of 
        the Standens (viz. <b>Edward Standen</b> who died Sept. 1730) had passed to 
        <b>Mr. Aldworth</b>, a minor and subsequently father of the 1st Lord Braybrooke; 
        The Minor’s Guardian sold the manor of Arborfield to <b>Mr. Pelsant Reeves</b>, 
        a Master in “Chancery”, but not the Living, which Lysons in his History 
        of Berks says was reserved in the family of <b>Braybrooke</b>. So how Mrs. 
        Elizabeth Waterman came to present the <b>Rev’d John Waterman</b> in 1739 - and 
        the <b>Rev Richard Hayes</b> in 1755, who died in 1797 - (42 years Rector) and 
        whose table tomb is now in Good preservation in the Grave Yard of old Arborfield Church, and who the Richard Hayes Esquire is, I am at a loss 
        to conjecture! - on the death of Rev’d Richard Hayes in 1797, the living 
        was given by the then Lord Braybrooke to the <b>Rev’d Henry Hodgkinson</b>,

        The Feast of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle - AUGUST 24th<br>
        <br>
        St. Bartholomew, according to legend was martyred by being skinned 
        alive. Hence he is the patron of butchers, skinners, tanners, 
        bookbinders and all leatherworkers. This day was famous for its fairs, 
        especially the great Bartholomew Fair at Smithfield, in London.<br>
        <br>
        “If Bartlemas Day be fine and clear<br>
        You may hope for a prosperous Autumn that year.”<br>
        <br>
        Some say that St. Bartholomew brings in the cooler Autumn weather - “St. 
        Bartholomew brings in the cold dew” - and that his day ends the forty 
        days of rain presaged by a wet St. Swithins.<br>
        <br>
        “All the tears St. Swithins can cry<br>
        St. Barthelmy’s mantle can wipe dry.”<br>
