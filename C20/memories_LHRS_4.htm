This is the fourth article for Arborfield in the Berkshire <b>Local History Recording Scheme</b>, 
reference A6-4:<p align="center"><b><font size="4">'Old &amp; New Churches'</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The ruin of the Old Church is situated 
next to Arborfield Hall, on the site of the original Saxon Church, or Chapel, of 
Eburgfield.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A Church built of chalk and flint with a 
wooden spire was erected before, or in the year, 1236. It consisted of a Chancel 
and Nave and there was a transept on the North side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1863 a faculty was obtained for the 
demolition of the Church on the score that the roof was in a dangerous condition 
and the Church was too small for the congregation. This faculty authorised the 
removal of monuments and memorial tablets to the New Church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Faculties were also granted for the 
conversion of the North aisle of the Church into two Mortuary Chapels by Thomas 
Hargreaves, Esq., of Arborfield Hall, and Sir John Conroy, of Arborfield Grange.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1869 these Chapels were erected, the 
one to the East becoming the Hargreaves and that on the West the Conroy Mortuary 
Chapels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A marble tablet to Edward Standen and 
his wife and an alabaster and marble monument to William Standen, his wife and 
child were removed into the East Chapel and remained there until December, 1938, 
when they were transferred to the New Church.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Memorial 
Tablets to Pelsant Reeves at one time owner of Arborfield Hall and to other 
members of that family </span>were removed to the New Church at some date before 
1900 and tablets bearing the inscriptions on those memorials were placed in the 
Hargreaves Chapel.</p>
<p>Tablets to the memory of three members of the Hargreaves family and to two of 
the Washington Jackson family were erected in the same Chapel by Mrs. Thomas 
Hargreaves, nee Jackson, and also in the New Church.</p>
<p>In the Conroy Chapel there are five marble memorial tablets to members of the 
Conroy family and one to Thomas Mahon, a godson of Sir John Conroy.</p>
<p>The inscriptions on these memorials are included in the list of memorial 
inscriptions in the Old Church and Churchyard deposited at the Reading Reference 
Library.</p>
<p>When the Standen memorials were transferred to the New Church in December 
1938 – January 1939, to make room for them three pews were removed from the West 
end of the Nave on the North side. The monument was re-erected on new paving of 
Excelsior Patent Stone Paving.</p>
<p>When in its original position and also when in the Hargreaves Chapel, the 
William Standen memorial had been built with its North and East sides adjoining 
walls. This is shown by the unfinished condition of the left side of the effigy 
of the lady and the back of the child. When the memorial was re-erected in the 
New Church the lower parts of the North and East sides of the memorial were 
reconstructed of new materials and the effigy of the child was placed facing 
East instead of West as it had faced originally.</p>
<p>The dismantling and re-erection of the memorials was carried out by Mr. A. F. 
Jones, Mason, of Reading, under the supervision of Mr. C. Birdwood Willcocks, 
F.S.A., F.R.I.B.A, Architect, of Reading. </p>
<p>At the same time as the memorials were moved, the wooden font from the 
Hargreaves' Chapel was also taken to the New Church.</p>
<p>With regard to the windows in the New Church on the South side of the Nave. 
The plain glass in the third window has been replaced by a window representing 
the marriage feast at Cana. On the lower part are the words, "Draw out now and 
bear to the governor of the feast" and beneath:-</p>
<p>"To the beloved memory of William Vincent Died July 15, 1904 and Sarah Jane, 
his wife, who died Dec. 7, 1916".</p>
<p>The West window is a single lancet and was specially made to receive part of 
the glass from the East window of the Old Church. It represents the head of 
Aaron. The glass was painted by John Rowell of Reading.</p>
<p>Of this window as it figured in the Old Church, the Rev. Charles Coates, LL.B., 
writes in his History and Antiquities of Reading, 1802:-</p>
<p>'In the Church at Arborfield in Berks. is a window over the Altar of two 
compartments in which are represented in half length the figures of Moses and 
Aaron by Rowell, holding the Tablets of the Law. The colours of the drapery are 
crimson, blue and purple, all very rich; the breastplate of Aaron is remarkably 
brilliant'.</p>
<p>This window was given by the Rev. John Waterman, M.A., in 1744. He was Rector 
from 1739 to 1755. </p>
