        <b>Stained Glass from Old Arborfield Church</b><br>
        <br>
        What has long been thought to be some pieces of Old Flemish glass in the 
        new church of Arborfield, have been found to be the work of an 18th 
        century glass stainer of Reading.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        It appears that when the old church was abandoned in 1863, an attempt 
        was made to take down the stained glass window over the altar. In the 
        process the glass was badly damaged, and only a head (Aaron) was saved. 
        The other fragments were thrown away. The true story of this window is 
        as follows:-<br>
        <br>
        Among the less worthies of Reading in the 18th century was John Rowell, 
        by calling a plumber, who also practised the more artistic craft of 
        painting on glass, first at High Wycombe, and afterwards at Reading. 
        While it cannot be said that his skill was equal to that of the glass 
        stainers of the earlier and glorious epochs, he is reputed to have 
        discovered the wonderful red which was so conspicuous a feature of 
        ancient work. His secret is supposed to have died with him in 1756. The 
        window at Arborfield has two compartments in which were represented in 
        half-length the figures of Moses and Aaron holding the two Tablets of 
        the Law. In 1802 it was stated that “the colours of the drapery are 
        crimson, blue and purple: all very rich: the breastplate of Aaron 
        remarkably brilliant.” Under the window was an inscription in the Latin 
        and Greek tongues stating that the work was done in the year 1744, when 
        John Waterman was rector. He also bore the cost as well as that of 
        beautifying the chancel of the church.<br>
