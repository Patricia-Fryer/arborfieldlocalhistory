There were several local ghost stories that were covered 
in a series of articles from 'The Times and Weekly News' of 1938, by a writer who 
signed him or herself as <b>'THE ROMANY'</b>.<p>Here are a few articles that 
related to Arborfield, plus a reader's letter.</p>

</font></b><font size="2">
<p>A great many places in town or country – usually country, being sufficiently 
old – have, nine times out of ten, a ghost story attached to them. A great many 
of these stories have been handed down through generations while others are 
merely vain suppositions and perhaps products of a lively imagination.</p>
<p>However, in these enlightened times no one pays attention to old country 
superstitions, nor do they any longer speak of ghosts and witches with bated 
breath. A few generations back it was not so, and such things caused a great 
sensation – especially when told in the village inn over the landlord’s good 
ale, while the fire roared up the spacious chimney, and a winter wind howled and 
moaned outside. Here is one of the most remarkable belonging to this district: -
</p>
</font><font size="3"><b>
<p align="center">‘The Laying of a Ghost’ </p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>In the <b>Swallowfield road</b> at Arborfield there stand two old far<a href="../images/whites_and_bartletts_1963.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="White's Farm on the left, and Bartlett's Farm on the right - from a 1963 aerial photo " vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/Thumb/whites_and_bartletts_1963.jpg" width="287" height="209"></a>ms 
immediately opposite each other – <b><a href="../properties_whites.htm">White’s 
Farm</a></b> and <b><a href="../properties_bartletts.htm">Bartlett’s Farm</a></b>. 
At sometime back in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century, there lived at White’s 
Farm, a farmer and his wife. What their names were it is impossible to tell, but 
it may have been White or Maggs, as an adjoining hamlet is called <b>Magg’s 
Green</b>. However, that is immaterial. The farmer’s wife was widely rumoured to 
be a witch, and beside having the power to work magic, she was reported to have 
been so mean in her dealings with customers that it was her habit to serve them 
milk that was three parts water, and persistently give short weight in the butter 
and cheese.</p>
<p>After she had been dead a few months, it is said that several people saw at a 
certain time of night – a spectre prowling that lonely stretch of road, wringing 
its hands and moaning in a hollow voice: <b>"Weight and measure gave I never; 
Milk and water sold I ever!"</b> Then with a final groan it descended silently 
into a deep pond by the road-side.</p>
<p>It is alleged that this went on for some time until the whole neighbourhood 
became terrified, and were compelled to take drastic measures, these being seven 
Priests came out from Reading and a great flat stone was brought to the place by 
a party of men. When the ghost appeared, the Priests began chanting incantations 
which were used especially for such proceedings. As soon as the apparition had 
descended into the pond, the stone was heaved flatly down over the middle of it 
and sank below the water. Strangely enough, no more was heard of the ghost until 
about a hundred years later, when a party of labourers was set to clean out the 
pond. After digging it out to the bottom they came upon the flat stone, and were 
about to prise it up, when the foreman came up and wildly entreated them not to 
touch it, telling them that his father had been one of the men present when the 
ghost was put down, and if they touched the stone, the spectre would escape and 
start its night prowls afresh. How much truth there is in the whole thing no one 
knows, but the stone was certainly there when the pond was filled in during 
recent years, and undoubtedly it is still there today.</p>
<p>[<b>Note:</b> Many villagers are under the mistaken impression that this pond 
referred-to above was the one at the Cross. However, the village pond was still 
in use, though in a poor state, several years after this article was written. 
There used to be several ponds along the Swallowfield Road itself, and two 
possible locations are shown on the <b><a href="../tithemap_02.htm">Tithe 
Apportionment Map</a></b> near to <b>Chamberlain's Farm<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
and </span>Yew Tree Cottage<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. This map also showed

<p align="center"><b>‘When the Devil Came to Arborfield’</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>In the early part of the 1850’s there was a very hard winter. Snow lay on the 
ground for some weeks and, during that time, a curious thing occurred at 
Arborfield, and, if rumour can be depended upon, other parts of the country 
beside.</p>
<p><a href="../properties_Court.htm">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Arborfield Court, built on the 'Arborfield Hills'" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/Thumb/Collier/Collier_A371.jpg" width="146" height="100"></a>Early 
one morning, some extraordinary tracks were discovered in the snow on the <b>
Arborfield Hills</b>. They resembled a cloven-footed animal. So far there is 
nothing strange in that, but the curious part about it was that the tracks did 
not go in fours as an animal’s do, but in pairs like human tracks and, apart 
from that, they began suddenly!
<img border="1" hspace="5" alt="From Arborfield Hill via Pudding Lane, the Grange, the Hall and Earley" vspace="5" align="left" src="../images/Local_Map_1950_small2.JPG" width="284" height="253"></p>
<p>From the crest of the hill they proceeded downwards towards the <b>
Swallowfield road</b> where they suddenly ceased. Then the track was again taken 
up in <b>Pudding Lane</b>, which lies as a cut between the Swallowfield and main 
Reading roads. It was traced down the lane to the <b>Reading road</b> end where 
it ceased as suddenly as before. However, it was found again – this time, on the 
roof of an <b>old thatched cottage</b> which used to stand somewhere near <b>
Arborfield Grange</b>. From there it was taken up again in <b>Arborfield Hall 
park</b>, and went on for a time, ceasing in the direction of <b>Earley</b>, and 
no more was seen of it from that point.</p>
<p>This mystery was never cleared up, nor could any solution be arrived at, 
apart from the fact that it was commonly supposed by all and sundry that <b>the 
Devil himself had passed through Arborfield</b>. No one saw the possessor of the 
cloven hoof, or heard him as he silently padded over the snowbound countryside. 
So the mystery remained. A few days afterward it was heard that the same track 
had been found in <b>Norfolk</b> where it had again crossed the roofs of 
cottages. The mystery deepened. Again it was seen, and this time on the <b>coast 
of Denmark</b>! Whether this was identical with the others is not known for 
certain, but it was most probable, though somewhat fantastic. Speculation ran 
high.</p>
<p>The only possible solution is that the tracks were probably made by some rare 
species of <b>Eagle or Falcon</b>, as some of these birds have strange and 
rather clumsy feet that could easily have made a mark like that of a cloven hoof 
in the snow. It is probable that the bird had come from the mountains of Wales, 
or perhaps from Ireland, having been disturbed by the severe weather conditions, 
and made its way across the country by stages, walking occasionally to rest its 
wings. Having reached Norfolk, it eventually made its way across the North Sea 
to Denmark. A fantastic and far-fetched tale if you like, but it served to 
entertain the simple country folk of last century for many a long day whilst we, 
in this enlightened age of Radio and Talking Pictures, would not stop to think 
of such a thing twice.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Letters to the Editor: ‘Was the Arborfield Ghost Laid?’</p></b></font><font size="2">
<p>Sir, It was with the greatest interest that I read the contribution by <b>
‘The Romany’</b> for the following reasons. People living in Arborfield will 
remember several happenings, more or less tragic, which have taken place during 
the last few years at, or near, a spot in the Swallowfield Road, not very far 
from the Farm mentioned in the article by ‘The Romany’ in a recent issue of the 
‘Times’. It is headed <b>‘Some Local Ghost Legends’</b>, and tells the story of 
the laying of a ghost of 18<sup>th</sup> Century fame, and also the tale of 
another local witch. Now many people, like myself, must often have wondered 
whether there could not be some evil influence at work in this particular part 
of Arborfield, or whether, after all, it was pure coincidence. </p>
<p>The facts are as follows: In the road, near a farm building, which by the way 
had once been damaged by a storm, <b>
<a href="../WW1/WW1_into_1920s.htm#ARBORFIELD–ACCIDENT">a 
little girl was knocked down by a motor vehicle</a></b> and badly injured. But 
for the wonderful treatment she received at the hospital, she would not be alive 
today. A few yards further along the road, a little later, <b>a man cycling from 
work was killed by the fall of a tree</b>, and in a field a little way distant 
from the spot, <b><a href="../memories_air_crash_1931.htm">an aeroplane was 
wrecked</a></b> and two people well-known in society lost their lives.</p>
<p>Of lesser import was the fact that a <b>caravan</b> close by was burned out. 
Fortunately the occupant was away at the time. Hence my query? Thank God, or 
goodness (the terms are interchangeable), nothing untoward has happened here 
lately, but it gives me furiously to think. </p>
<p align="right">Yours faithfully, EVE.</p>

<p>This week's article mentions: 'A headless white lady, mounted on a white 
Palfrey, is rumoured to rise out of the <b>Rectory Marsh</b> at <b>Barkham</b>, 
and wend her way nightly, by a cross-country route to the water meadows by the
<b>‘Mole’</b> on the <b>Bear Wood Road</b>, and there disappear.'</p>

temperature dropped.]</p>

<p>Another ghost legend was described in detail in this week's article, but 
summarised below: </p>
<p><b>The Washington family’s coffins</b> were transferred at night-time from 
the old churchyard to a vault in the new churchyard. As the coffins were 
disinterred, a gale-force wind picked up and lasted until all of the coffins had 
been re-interred at the new churchyard, at which point the wind dropped and the 
moonlit night became still again.</p>
