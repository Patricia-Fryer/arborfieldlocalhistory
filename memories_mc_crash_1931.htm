        <p class="stbody">By 1931, cars and motor-cycles were increasing in 
        traction power, but they weren't quite so good in stopping. There were 
        very many road accidents; in only ten months between January and 
        October, there were around 1000 accidents and 10 fatalities within the 
        Reading Borough boundary. Outside the towns, the country roads were 
        generally in poor condition, and the <b>Reading - Eversley Road</b> didn't get a 
        Tarmac surface until the 1930s.&nbsp; Two fatal road accidents occurred 
        on this road within 4 months. Here is the first, as reported by the '<b>Reading 
        Mercury</b>':</p>

        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">A fatal motor-cycle accident which 
        occurred at Arborfield on Tuesday morning was the subject of an inquest 
        by the Reading coroner, <b>Mr. J. L. Martin</b>, sitting with a jury, 
        yesterday (Friday). The motor-cyclist, <b>David Dance</b>, a jeweller’s 
        assistant, age 21, of 40 Sherwood Street, Reading, was riding in the 
        vicinity of Arborfield Bridge when he collided with a motor-lorry, and 
        was thrown off. He died in the Royal Berkshire Hospital the same day. 
        The young man was spending his holidays touring with his machine, and 
        was returning to Reading after visiting a sister when the accident 
        occurred.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The bereaved father, <b>Sidney 
        Christopher Dance</b>, 43, King’s Road, Slough, said his son had ridden 
        a motor-cycle only three or four months.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>P. S. [Police Sargeant] Perkins</b>, 
        of Shinfield, said the accident occurred at a bend in the road about 50 
        yards on the Shinfield side of Arborfield Bridge. When he arrived at the 
        scene of the accident he found the motor-cyclist and his machine lying 
        at the side of the road, The man was unconscious, but the machine was 
        not badly damaged. There was a scratch 13 ft. long on the road caused by 
        one of the footrests of the motor-cycle. The lorry stopped 63 ft. from 
        the point of impact.</span></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Dangerous Bend.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner asked P. S. Perkins for 
        his opinion of the cause of the accident, and witness said he thought 
        the motor-cyclist must have taken the corner “too wide”. “It is a wicked 
        corner”, he added, “it looks easy to negotiate, but it is very 
        deceptive, and two or three times a year we have vehicles driving right 
        across the road and through the hedge”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Witness proceeded that he saw from 
        a mark in the sand at the side of the road that the lorry was being 
        driven on the proper side of the road. He thought the motor-cyclist’s 
        right knee, on which there was a deep cut, had just brushed the rear 
        wheel of the lorry and that had thrown him out of balance. The driver of 
        the lorry had told him that he felt no impact, but stopped when he heard 
        a crash on the road behind him.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Horace Frank Moseley</b>, 
        Newport Road, Reading, the driver of the lorry, who was represented by
        <b>Mr. T. O. L. Hawthorne</b>, solicitor, said that when the accident 
        occurred he was driving a load of timber for <b>Messrs. George Lewis, 
        Ltd</b>. He estimated his speed on the corner at 10 to 14 miles an hour. 
        He thought the motor-cyclist passed him safely, and had travelled 
        several hundred yards before he heard the crash, which caused him to 
        pull up.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Dr. W. I. Bain</b>, a house 
        surgeon at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, said the injured man had wounds 
        on his right knee, elbow, hand and shoulder, and was bleeding from the 
        right ear when admitted to the hospital. He died soon afterwards without 
        recovering consciousness, and a post mortem examination showed that a 
        blood vessel in the right lung had been torn. The jury returned a 
        verdict of “Accidental death”, exonerating the driver of the lorry from 
        blame.</span></p>
