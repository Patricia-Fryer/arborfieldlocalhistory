  <p class="stbody">Arborfield is a Parish situated in 
      one of the most favourable parts of the County. It has an area of about 
      1,427 acres, with a population of about 250 and consists of a small 
      village with one or two Shops, Post Office (a Pillar Box adjoins the 
      Grounds), and the Parish Church of St. Bartholomew, all within a [few] 
      minutes' walk of “The Grange”.

  <p class="stbody">Reading, the County Town, is distant 
      5½ miles, with an important Junction Station on the Main Line of the Great 
      Western Railway, whence London, the West of England and the Midlands are 
      reached by an excellent service of trains, many of those to the Metropolis 
      being non-stop and occupying 45 minutes only in the journey. There are 
      also branch termini on both the London and South Western and South East 
      and Chatham Railway systems.
        
        
  </p>

 

  <p class="stbody">The quaint old country town of 
      Wokingham and village of Earley are respectively about 4½ and 3 miles, 
      each with Stations on the London and South Western Railway and South 
      Easter[n] and Chatham Railway, and Sindlesham Halt Station on the South 
      Eastern Railway is about 2 miles.

  <p class="stbody">Such beautiful spots as Eversley and 
      Strathfieldsaye, immortalised as the homes respectively of the novelist, 
      Charles Kingsley, and the first and succeeding Dukes of Wellington are
