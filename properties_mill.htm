        <p class="stbody">The Reading Mercury of 15th August 1953 quoted a 
        previous issue of the Reading Mercury dated 4th August 1794, which detailed the auction of Arborfield paper mill. It stated <b>"Arborfield Mill - well supplied by 
        the river Loddon, with every conveniency for a considerable business". </b>
        The River Loddon flows below the former gardens of Arborfield Hall and 
        in 1953 a curiously castellated brick ex-mill, the foundations dating 
        back to 1500, was standing where mills have stood for centuries - with a 
        pool still supplying eels, as it did for the Bishops of Salisbury at 
        Sonning, at the time of the Domesday survey. </p>

        <p class="stbody">There had been a grist mill existing at Arborfield for 
        a great number of years and fishing rights which stretched back to the 
        16th century. This mill was established as a paper mill by Mr. George 
        Dawson. <br>
        <br>
        A number of <b><a href="properties_mill_owners.htm">paper makers</a></b> worked at the mill, a Mr. Hodgson being the 
        earliest known in 1787. In 1826 Charles Edward James worked at Arborfield Mill as a paper maker and at this time attached to the mill 
        were three brick built cottages, one lodge and a piece of meadow land. 
        The wheel was described as “the great water wheel” and a new 48 inch 
        paper machine was in use. In 1837, Thomas Miles, paper maker, is 
        mentioned in the registers and according to an article in the Reading 
        Mercury in 1953, it was claimed that banknote paper was 
        produced at Arborfield Mill; however, there are several documented 
        references that it made fine brown paper. The millers are thought to have lived in an 
        old house called <b>“Sans Souci”</b> situated in the meadow between the two 
        arms of the river, close to the mill.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The mill was a mixed blessing to its owners and 
        operators. It was known to have caught fire at least twice, with 
        two different accounts from 1829 (<b><a href="properties_mill_fire_1829_Times.htm">'The Times'</a></b>, whose proprietor 
        owned the Bearwood Estate, and the <b>
        <a href="properties_mill_fire_1829_Mercury.htm">'Reading Mercury'</a></b>), and again in 1861 
        (an account in the <b><a href="properties_mill_fire_1861_Mercury.htm">'Reading Mercury'</a></b>). We are grateful to <b>Dr. Daven 
        Chamberlain</b>, who is researching the paper-making history at the 
        Mill, for supplying us with many fascinating notes covering its various 
        owners, policies for fire 
        insurance, auction sales, bankruptcies and other events, including the 
        absconding of an employee.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="stbody">George Pelsant Dawson (son of George) inherited Arborfield 
        House and Estate from his father. In about 1840, he sold the park and 
        house to Sir John Conroy, Controller to the household of the Duchess of 
        Kent, Mother of Queen Victoria. Sir Edward Conroy in turn inherited 
        Arborfield Hall from his father, but finding that he could not afford to 
        live there, sold the Hall and park to Mr. John Hargreaves in 1855 for 
        his son Thomas. Captain Thomas Hargreaves died in 1891. His heir was his 
        second son Mr. John Reginald Hargreaves and his mother Mrs. Hargreaves 
        lived at the Hall. In 1861 a <b><a href="properties_mill_deed_of_arrangement.htm">Deed of 
        Arrangement </a></b>had to be drawn up between the Hargreaves family and 
        the then mill owner, Alfred Towgood.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">Here is a map showing the layout of the Farm and the 
        Mill:</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" src="images/Arborfield%20farm%20and%20mill.jpg" width="432" height="424"></p>

        <p class="stbody">At some later date Mrs. Hargreaves 
        is said to have had some of the Mill pulled down. It must have been 
        rebuilt because a sale document of 1919 describes the mill as “A 
        picturesque building of brick with tiled roof, fitted with a 40 H.P. 
        water wheel and a 26 H.P. Turbine, with necessary shafting etc. 
        providing power for driving the pumps for water supply, Dynamo for 
        Electric Current and for working the machinery on Home Farm”.&nbsp; This 
        view from the early 1950's is taken from near the weir.</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b>Mr. H.C.Longhurst</b> who visited the Mill at Arborfield 
        probably in the 1960s recalled that the millstones were in position on 
        the first floor of the two storey buildings at the farm and that there 
        were a number of pulley wheels on the outside of the building facing the 
        River Loddon which was about 150 feet away. His main interest was in 
        trying to discover what form of power had been used to drive the grist 
        mill that he remembered being taken to see. He wrote up his findings in 
        1984.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Longhurst found a block plan of Sir John Conroy’s farm 
        buildings which revealed an engine house but no water turbine (this plan 
        must be dated between about 1840 and 1855 when Sir John owned Arborfield 
        House and Estate). He was pleased to discover that the engine used by Sir 
        John Conroy had been one from the Reading works of Barrett, Exall &amp; 
        Andrews, although it was not possible to learn if the two steam engines 
        for the later paper mill were from the same source.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Longhurst eventually found, at the Berkshire Record 
        Office, a mention of a water turbine on the paper mill site which had 
        been used by Hargreaves to drive a dynamo with which to light Arborfield 
        Hall and other buildings. This turbine plus dynamo could not have been 
        part of the paper making concern. However the turbine had been built by 
        Charles Louis Hett and had driven a 100 watt dynamo with lead acid 
        batteries and its date of manufacture was 1885 (the first use of 
        electric lighting in a house was in 1880).<br>
        <br>
        In the early 1920’s Guthrie Allsebrook had become the owner with a view 
        to using the water rights to supply the local authority with water. The 
        Allsebrooks had found the turbine with dynamo at Arborfield and had used 
        it to sink a new borehole on the site and eventually to drive a pump. 
        They also found a large iron pipe lying in the bed of the river from 
        which fountains could be produced from a pump driven by the turbine. A 
        water spectacular at Arborfield!<br>
        <br>
        Finally it was discovered that the small grist mill mentioned earlier 
        had been driven from the old water wheel, a breast-type 10 foot diameter 
        x 8 foot, by a system of shafting which ran for most of its length in 
        shallow ducting. The Allsebrooks dismantled the old water wheel.<br>
        <br>
        The ground floor remains, roofed with corrugated 
        asbestos sheeting. It is now used by Thames Water. The Local History 
        Society visited the site on 14th June 2004, and in this photo Barry 
        Salter is showing an ornate window with embellishments now partially 
        hidden by pebble-dashing, and two stone slit windows hidden by ivy.</p>
