the "people's friend" and at the gates of the park appeared the village of Sindlesham, a school, a clubhouse, a cricket-field, and finally, in 1846, a

<p align="center" class="sthead"><b><font size="4">DEATH OF MR. WALTER. </font></b></p>
<p>(<i>From the "Times"</i>)</p>
<p>The mournful aspect assumed by our journal this morning will widely 
communicate what has been for some time painfully expected – the death of <b>
John Walter, Esq., of Bearwood,</b> in the county of Berks. Widely indeed will 
his death be known, when the notice of it has been read in that publication 
which he had made the chief record of passing events, as well as the most 
powerful organ of public opinion, not only in these islands, not only in the 
vast populations that own the same rule, or speak the same language as 
ourselves, but throughout the whole earth. The myriads who daily peruse these 
columns have before them the monument of his merits and powers.</p>
<p>It was a matter of life-long regret to Mr. Walter, that engaged, as he had 
been, in the most varied and responsible business from a very early age, and 
surprised, as it were, by a continual succession of arduous undertakings, he had 
never rendered a due portion of his time to the duties and enjoyments of 
domestic life. Most public men feel this; but Mr. Walter felt it enough to 
regard with great jealousy any addition to his political engagements. It was 
under this feeling, that, contrary to the advice of his friends, he resigned in 
1837 his seat for the county of Berks, which he had taken in 1832. His 
indignation at the injustice and cruelty done to the poor by a notorious act, 
and at the triumphant tone of its advocates in Parliament, hurried him again 
into harassing, tedious, and expensive contests. It was his desire to re-enter 
the House of Commons with the <i>préstige</i> of a great popular 
constituency, and, armed with a public commission, to throw back in the face of 
the Minister the oft-repeated vaunt that the Poor Law was acceptable to the 
people of England. Time, however, reserved his triumph. The verdict of England 
reached Mr. Walter in the chamber of death. It was there that he heard the fate 
of the once potent Commission.</p>
<p>It would scarcely be possible to enumerate or describe the whole of what not 
merely this journal but all the journals of the civilized world, owe to Mr. 
Walter. He first imparted to the daily press its vast range and celerity of 
information, its authentic accuracy, its universal correspondence, its lucid 
arrangement and marvellous despatch – and, more than all, its dignity in the 
social scale, and its political position as what has been called the fourth 
estate of the realm. He was not only a great tribune, but the founder of a 
tribunitial rank and authority.</p>
<p>Amongst other acts of early exertions for the press may be mentioned his 
successful competition for priority of intelligence with the Government during 
the European war, which (to mention a single instance) enabled this journal to 
announce the capitulation of Flushing 48 hours before the news had arrived 
through any other channel; and the extinction of what before his time had been 
an invariable practice with the General Post-office, strange as it may now 
appear, - the systematic retardation of foreign intelligence, and the public 
sale of foreign news for the benefit of the Lombard-street officials.</p>
<p>It was his active and well-directed enterprise, his fertility of invention, 
and lavish generosity, that first drew a continual stream of intelligence from 
the furthest realms of the civilized world, instructed and enlightened in return 
by his political genius and sagacity, as well as frequently charmed and won over 
to his convictions by the eloquence which he retained, directed, and approved. 
Mr. Walter was the prime author and the chief upholder of that celebrity and 
influence which <i>The Times</i> journal possesses. Though always ready to show 
the kindest and most flattering confidence in those whom he had trained to the 
honourable service, he never withdrew, even after he ceased to be ostensible 
manager, the aid of those counsels which they could not too highly appreciate. 
He may rightly, therefore, be considered the sole architect of the mighty fabric 
which is without a rival in its dignity and proportions, and the foundations of 
which are so deeply laid in the affections and esteems of the public as to defy 
all ordinary and probable vicissitudes and attacks.</p>
<p>But one achievement alone is sufficient to place Mr. Walter high in that list 
which the world, as it grows older and wiser, will more and more appreciate –
</p>
<p><b><i>"Inventes aut qui vitam excoluere per artes.<br>
Quique sui memores alles fecere merendu"</i></b>.</p>
<p>He first brought the steam-engine to the assistance of the public press. 
Familiar as the discovery is now, there was a time when it seemed fraught with 
difficulties as great as those which Fulton has overcome on one element and 
Stephenson on another. To take off 5,000 impressions in an hour was once as 
ridiculous a conception as to paddle a ship fifteen miles against wind and tide, 
or to drag in that time a train of carriages weighing a hundred tons fifty 
miles. Mr. Walter, who, without being a visionary, may be said to have thought 
nothing impossible that was useful and good, was early resolved that there 
should be no impossibility in printing by steam.</p>
<p>As a step in the progress of civilization, the steam press can only be 
compared to the original discovery of printing itself. Steam gave wings to the 
press, enlarging its powers to the scale of the world. It has enabled the 
metropolitan press to issue an adequate supply for all England even before the 
inhabitants of the metropolis itself have assembled at the breakfast table. By 
this potent aid we printed and circulated fifty thousand copies of our paper, 
containing Sir Robert Peel’s celebrated speech announcing the repeal of the Corn 
Laws, in the course of the following morning.</p>
<p>His devotion to the cause which by day and night engrossed his interest and 
his powers, and never allowed him the needful repose, probably cost Mr. Walter 
not only his ease and comfort, but his health and his life. He early perceived 
the dangerous character of the symptoms, which made their appearance rather more 
than a twelvemonth since. He was aware that his only chance was repose of body 
and mind. But private affairs of a peculiarly harassing and distressing 
character debarred him from that needful repose, and even entailed a serious 
increase of anxious occupation. In the extreme discomfort of his complaint, and 
the physical disability for business it occasioned, and not less in his 
comparative freedom during so many months from acute pain and mental 
prostrations, he thankfully and warmly recognized a providential opportunity for 
amending, as far as might be, the omissions of a life, the object to which his 
last and longest and ripest energies had been devoted.</p>
<p>Early in the progress of 
the complaint, which was a cancer in the face, Mr. Walter, for the sake of 
medical attendance, took up his abode at his residency at <b>Printing-house-square</b>, 
where, after many months of suffering, he expired on Wednesday, at a quarter 
before 2 o’clock a.m. in the 71<sup>st</sup> year of his age.</p>
