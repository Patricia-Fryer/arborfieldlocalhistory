        <p class="stbody">
        On the left of this view is Eversley Road, with the entrance to 
		Poperinghe Barracks to the left, and the married quarters of Hazebrouck 
		Barracks to the right. Most, but not all, of these married quarters were 
		in Barkham, but several were listed in the Electoral Register for 
		Arborfield.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Some of these married quarters in Valon Road were built in 1939. Later, 
        the road layouts in Valon 
        Road, Venning Road and Hill Road were completely 
        redesigned, and additional houses were put into the gaps.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Eversley Road was split into three sections when the Garrison By-Pass 
        was built. The Council-Houses at the top of the photo became part of 
        Rickman Close, while those to the south formed part of Bramshill Close, 
        named after the pub which can just be seen near the top left of the 
        picture. A new service road named Baird Road severed the most southerly 
        part of Eversley Road, leaving the line of houses at the bottom of the 
        photo in a cul-de-sac of what became Sheerlands Road. Many of the 
        military buildings changed their uses over the years, and most of those 
        shown both at the top and at the bottom were later demolished.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        For a good pen-picture of what the Garrison was like in 1946, here is a 
        description of the first 'At Home' held on 17th August, as described in 
        the Wokingham 'Times and Weekly News' dated 23rd August:</p>

        <font size="3">
        <p align="center" class="stbody"><b><font size="4">R.E.M.E. hold their 
        first ‘At Home’</font></b></p>
        <p align="center" class="stbody"><b><font size="4">Over 4,000 Visitors 
        Entertained</font></b></p>
        </font><font SIZE="2">
        <p class="stbody"><i>A grand programme was offered to members of the 
        public by the R.E.M.E. at Hazebrouck Barracks, Arborfield, when the 
        whole training centre was thrown open to visitors on Saturday afternoon. 
        This was R.E.M.E.’s first ‘At Home’, and a highly successful event it 
        proved, giving the large gathering a wonderful opportunity to see for 
        themselves some of the mechanical and electrical devices that played 
        such a big part in winning the war.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>[Photo: ‘Waterproofed Lorry entering the Water 
        Splash’]</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>Perhaps one of the most popular features from the 
        point of view of the younger folk was the Vehicle Wading, which provided 
        a real thrill for the passengers. Throughout the afternoon and evening 
        Army lorries, their engines specially waterproofed for waterborne 
        landing, were being driven down a steel ramp into nearly six feet of 
        water, each vehicle carrying a full complement of passengers in the 
        driver’s cabin. One of the drivers – Craftsman Walmsley was having a 
        &quot;busman’s holiday&quot; in more ways than one – he had taken part in the 
        &quot;real thing&quot; in Italy.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>Riding or perhaps one should say &quot;rollicking&quot; 
        across the fields in Bren Gun carriers was well patronised by both 
        children and grown-ups, and despite the fact that a number of carriers 
        were busy collecting passengers, the queue never seemed to get any 
        shorter throughout the whole afternoon. Rides on tanks were another very 
        popular feature and passengers got quite a thrill in these huge 
        juggernauts – sliding and slipping around on the test field, The tank 
        recovery unit also attracted a large audience. Possibly one of the most 
        impressive and spectacular displays of the day was the Flamethrowing 
        tanks. The belching of flames over distances of 100 yards at a target 
        &quot;enemy&quot; tank, with disastrous effect to the latter, left one in no doubt 
        as to the terrible fate of its crew in actual warfare.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>[Photo: ‘Off for a spin in a tank’]</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>The compactibility of the mobile workshops was 
        something to amaze the civilian workman. One vehicle in question 
        contained a small lathe, bench, drill, grinder, acetylene welding kit, 
        in addition to a generating plant. Other mobile units included the Radar 
        vans, where people were able to see for themselves for the first time 
        how enemy aircraft were seen on the Radar screen, their distance traced, 
        and the necessary information handed on to the guns for attack.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>In the armament section were 25 pounder MK3, used 
        for jungle warfare, with a range of no less than 13,400 yards; 5.5 
        Howitzers, MK1 Anti-tank guns, and largest of all the American 155 m.m. 
        M.1., with a range of 25,395 yards. A crew of at least six men is needed 
        to handle this monster.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>On the main parade ground, a continuous programme 
        was given of motor cycle track riding, physical training displays, and 
        drills. A good deal of amusement was caused by a mock parade of supposed 
        &quot;raw recruits&quot; and a much-harassed Sergeant-Major. This was followed by 
        a ceremonial drill, carried out by men who had actually only been in the 
        Service 11 weeks. The entire drill was carried out with the most perfect 
        precision, and at its conclusion the salute was taken by General Sir 
        Bertram Rowcroft, K.B.E., G.B., who also reviewed the first physical 
        training display. The second P.T. display of the day was inspected by 
        Brig. L. N. Tyler, C.B.E., Commandant of the Training Centre.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>Visitors were able to inspect the vast N.A.A.F.I. 
        building, where very welcome cups of tea were served with cakes and 
        salad rolls, on presentation of a tea ticket. <b>The smartly-painted 
        married quarters were viewed with some envy by many would-be house 
        hunters.</b></i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>It was impossible not to be impressed by the 
        spotless cleanliness and modern equipment of every building – from the 
        N.A.A.F.I. to the splendid gymnasium, outside which boxing displays were 
        given in the afternoon and evening before an admiring crowd. Although it 
        is impossible to record in detail all the points of interest, the &quot;At 
        Home&quot; afforded the civilian some idea of the extent of the mechanical 
        efficiency of the British Army today.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>The entire afternoon’s programme had been planned 
        with great care and forethought, and in addition to special ‘bus 
        services from Reading and Wokingham stations, the Camp ran its own 
        &quot;taxi&quot; service to and from the car park to the display centres – a 
        gesture which was very much appreciated by tired sightseers at the end 
        of the day. The R.E.M.E’s own band provided the music throughout the 
        afternoon.</i></p>
        <p class="stbody">[This news item was transcribed from a microfilm at 
        Bracknell Local Studies Library, with acknowledgement to the 'Times' 
        series of newspapers. In addition to this, there were full illustrated 
        reports of the event in the 'Reading Standard' and in the 'Reading 
        Mercury', both of which can be seen on microfilm at Reading Local 
        Studies Library.]</p>
