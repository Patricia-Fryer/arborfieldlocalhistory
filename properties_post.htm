        <p class="stbody">The Old Post Office building is thought to be late 
        15th or early 16th century. It was home to the Mattingley family for 200 
        years, and became a Post Office in the later 1800's. Next door to the 
        south was the old forge with its wheel pit in front (the circular cover 
        for the pit was still in place in the 1970's). This old postcard shows 
        both buildings in their heyday.</p>
