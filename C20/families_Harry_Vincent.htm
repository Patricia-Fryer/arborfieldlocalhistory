were the local wheelwrights and makers of wagons and carts in the 19th Century,

<p class="MsoNormal">However, the family maintained strong links with 
Arborfield, as the following news articles about <b>Harry Vincent</b> from the 'Reading Mercury' make 
clear. <b>Harry Ernest Reed Vincent </b>was baptised at Arborfield on September 
29th 1878, the son of <b><a href="families_William_Vincent.htm">William and Sarah Jane Vincent</a></b>. In the 1901 Census, 
Harry was described as a <b>'Coachbuilder's Assistant'</b> at the business in 
Arborfield Cross.</p>

<p>Two-column article on Mr. Vincent’s death</b>, mentioning the family’s links 
with Arborfield before moving to Reading. It stated <i><b>‘The funeral took 
place privately at Arborfield Parish Church on Tuesday, with which the Vincent 
family have long and close association.’</b></i></p>
<p>From January 18th: </p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>Memorial Service for Mr. Harry Vincent</b> </p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>[The service was taken by Canon Anderson on Sunday morning, January 12th. 
More than 100 employees plus members of the Vincent family were present. This 
article explained that the employees could not attend the funeral – the previous 
Tuesday – because of war work].</p>
<p>Prior to the service, two employees whose joint years of service in the 
employ of <b>Vincents of Reading </b>totalled 79 years, laid a wreath upon the 
grave, and in silence, with evident grief, all the employees slowly and 
reverently filed past the grave on their way to the church. </p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><a name="At">At</a> the conclusion of the service, the organist played <b>
‘The Holy City’</b> while the whole congregation remained standing. Never has 
this music been heard to better effect, although for more than 50 years it has 
been sung, played and heard by millions in all parts of the world. Whether it 
was by request, or the organist’s choice, the writer knows not, but as the 
strains of this age-long music floated up, filling the whole church with 
solemnity and grandeur, in a setting in the heart of the country, where 
stillness and quiet reigned

and where the noise and turbulence of the outside world was forgotten; where the 
promise of spring – jasmine in full bloom – was to be seen; where modern 
electricity was lacking, and paraffin lamps hung from the old oak beams; where 
week by week the yeomen of England find joy in simple worship; where freedom 
abounds and unspoilt is the landscape, the triumphant climax of <b>‘Jerusalem, 
Jerusalem lift up your voice </b><b>and sing’</b>, brought to a close a memorial 
service which all who attended will long remember. </p>
<p><b>Mr. J. H. Simonds</b> read the lessons, and amongst those present were <b>
Mr. and Mrs. W. R. Vincent</b>, <b>Miss Z. Vincent</b>, <b>Miss M. Vincent</b>,
<b>Miss Hickmott</b>, and a large number of Arborfield and district residents.</p>
