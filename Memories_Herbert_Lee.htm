<p class="stbody"><b>Newland Farm</b> was part of the <b>Newlands estate</b> and 
as such was offered for sale with the rest of the Estate in 1947 by the Simonds 
family. It was ‘Lot 2’ of the sale and described as ‘The Well-Farmed 
Agricultural Holding known as Newland Farm, Arborfield, extending to about 235 
acres 2 roods’. The farm extended to Pudding Lane in the west, the old Bear Lane 
north of Monk’s cottage, and Wood Lane in the east. It didn’t include the field 
behind the school. The farm also included some cottages adjacent to ‘The Swan’ 
and also Hazelton’s Copse. The majority of this Lot was in the occupation of <b>
Mr. H. G. Lee </b>on a yearly Michaelmas tenancy at an informally apportioned 
rent of £280. 18s. 0d. per annum.</p>
<p class="stbody">In July 1948 Newland Farm was offered for sale once again. On 
this occasion 248 acres 1 rood 32 poles of land were for sale and a block of 
three brick and tiled cottages were added to the sale. These are situated 
between Cole Lane and School Road. Hazelton’s Copse was not included in the 
sale, but there was an option to purchase the freehold for £100 up to 24<sup>th</sup> 
June 1953. </p>
<p class="stbody">In 1950 Newland Farm was sold to the Griffiths brothers of 
Stokenchurch whilst <b>Herbert Lee</b> continued to farm it. Almost immediately 
the Griffiths cut down 400 oak and elm trees for use in the furniture industry 
in High Wycombe, and later in 1971 they felled another 250 oaks, the rest of the 
elms having died of Dutch Elm disease.</p>
<p class="stbody">Until 1963, the mainstay was dairy cattle (as noted in some 
detail in the <b><a href="C20/memories_LHRS_8.htm">Local History Recording 
Scheme</a></b>), but Herbert Lee wasn't given permission by the landlord to 
erect new milking sheds, so the emphasis turned to rearing sheep, which were 
first introduced in 1963. </p>
<p class="stbody">By 1975 the brothers had died and <b>Henry Lee</b> was offered 
first option on the farm, which he took and bought it. Henry has been the owner 
of Newland Farm ever since. Herbert Lee, Henry’s father, died in 1994 at the 
good age of 87 years.</p>
<p class="stbody">(With grateful thanks to Mr. Henry Lee for his help).</p>
