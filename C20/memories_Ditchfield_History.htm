<p>The Internet has brought an old book back to life by focusing on its contents 
and not on its title. <b>"Byways in Berkshire and the Cotswolds"</b>, by <b>P. 
H. Ditchfield, M.A., F.S.A.</b>, and published in by <b>Robert Scott in London 
in 1920</b> is not really about byways at all. </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
<b>
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Rev. Peter Ditchfield, Rector of Barkham" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/Ditchfield_Notes/Peter_Ditchfield.jpg" width="139" height="199"></b></font>Its author, the <b>Rev. Peter Ditchfield</b>, knew Berkshire well. Having 
been a curate at <b>Sandhurst</b> and at <b>Christ Church, Reading</b>, he was
<b>Rector of Barkham Church</b> from 1886 until his death in 1930. He was a 
prolific author, writing many books on diverse subjects. He also wrote 'Notes 
and Queries' for the <b>Reading Mercury </b>for many years, and was president of
<b>Berkshire Archaeological Society</b>.</p>

<p>The book is divided into two main parts: The <b>Windsor Forest</b> and the <b>
Cotswolds</b> (which until 1974 reached into the west of the old Berkshire), and 
is a guide-book of many local towns and villages, introduced via itineraries of 
rambles and boat-trips, full of local history and amusing anecdote.  </p>

<p>Two of his 
'journeys' pass through Arborfield, hence the book's inclusion on this web-site. 
Peter was so well-connected that he casually mentioned then-famous names such as
<b>Prince Christian</b> throughout the book. He made some robust comments on the 
errors of other historians, particularly on the derivation of place-names such 
as <b>Arborfield</b>.</p>

  <p class="sthead">

        <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
 
<p>Although 'Byways' was published in 1920, it is clear that most of it was 
written while the <b><a href="../WW1/WW1_main_page.htm">Great War</a></b> was still raging, and so it gives us a rare snapshot 
into life in the local area during those difficult times. For example, when 
describing <b>Barkham</b>, he said:</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>"The war has made us a semi-military village and khaki 
is seen everywhere. <br>We have a Remount Depot just beyond our borders. <br>Horses and 
mules parade our roads and dwell in our fields, <br>and we send them with sad hearts 
on their way to the front <br>to help our men to fight our battles for England and 
to win the victory."</i></b></p>

<p>Of the young men, he lamented:</p>

<p align="center">
<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-WEIGHT: 700">
<font size="2">"There is no sight in the world, I suppose, so beautiful, so 
wonderful, <br>as Henley Regatta on a bright summer day. Many of its heroes, <br>grand 
young-limbed athletes, lie in unknown graves in France and Flanders. <br>Maimed 
warriors will, perhaps, come to see the scenes of their former triumphs; <br>but I 
question whether the regatta will ever be the same again." </font></span></p>

<p>And of <b>Windsor Forest</b> itself:</p>

<p align="center"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-WEIGHT: 700">
<font size="2">"It is impossible not to regret the necessity which the war laid 
upon us for the destruction of our woodlands. Our Windsor Forest has suffered 
with the rest of the country. The regions of Ascot, Virginia Water and Sunningdale have paid heavy toll to Canadian lumbermen. We have made great 
sacrifices during the war, and amongst these must be counted the serene beauty 
of many an English landscape, and the loss of stately trees which none now 
living will ever see replaced."</font></span></p>

<p>And closer to home, the woodlands around <b>Eversley</b>, beloved of <b>Charles 
Kingsley</b>:</p>

<p align="center">
<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-WEIGHT: 700">
<font size="2">"Such is the onward march of the firs which we love to watch in 
these days as much as Kingsley did. But the woodman's axe is laying heavy toll 
upon our forests. <br>Owing to the war, ships can no longer bring to us the spoils of 
Norwegian woods, <br>and we are obliged to help ourselves to our own native stock. 
<br>So Canadian lumbermen, German prisoners and our own people <br>are busily employed 
in cutting down these fir forests, <br>and large tracts of country are as bare as 
barge-boards. <br>But the heather will spring up again and the young firs seed and 
spread themselves, and there will be much planting, and nature will recover 
herself <br>as England herself will do when the war is over, <br>and we beat our swords 
into ploughshares and our spears into pruning-hooks. England like our fir 
forests has a wonderful capacity for recovery." </font></span></p>

<p align="left">
Some seemingly-unkind words about <b>Maidenhead</b> were probably prompted by <b>
<a href="../WW1/WW1_Food_Shortages.htm">food 
rationing in towns in 1917</a></b>: </p>

<p align="center">
<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-WEIGHT: 700">
<font size="2">"Lately the town has suffered from the advent of aliens from 
London, <br>anxious to escape from the terror of air-raids. <br>Like locusts they have 
descended upon the town, <br>and devoured all the fat of the land and ate the fruits 
of the ground". </font></span></p>

        <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chapter 1 - "Windsor Forest":</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A forest is, according to the dictum of those who are 
learned in the law, " a territory bounded by unremovable marks, or by 
prescription, in which beasts and fowls of forest, chase and warren, abide under 
the protection of the king." According to another authority "it is the highest 
franchise of princely pleasure." The trees do not make the forest, but the law 
of the land determined that the forest was set apart for the hunting of the 
sovereign, and for those who received the royal permission to hunt therein. [P.4]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Forests were made to wander in, at least they are so in 
modern days, when there are no such fearful penalties as loss of life or limb, no 
horrid mantraps or spring-guns to startle or to maim ; and as a wanderer in this 
Windsor Forest I claim my right to wander as I list, in history, lore, legend, 
or topography, and cull what pleases me, disregarding the beaten track so worn 
by many weary pilgrims. [P.4-5]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It extended its sway over parts of <b>Buckinghamshire</b> 
and <b>Middlesex</b>, nearly the whole of <b>Surrey</b> and the eastern and 
southern parts of <b>Berkshire</b>, as far as <b>Hungerford</b>, while the <b>
Vale of Kennett</b> was deemed anciently to be within its borders. [P.5]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>He traced the <b>Devil's Highway</b> westwards towards
<b>Silchester</b>, and remarked: </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes you have to exercise the cunning of a Red Indian 
tracker to discover this road; in other places it is as plain as a pikestaff. 
[P.7]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It then mounts the hill known as <b>Finchampstead Ridges</b>, 
though avoiding its steepest slopes. Stop at the summit and admire the view. 
This is one of the most famous beauty spots in Berkshire, or indeed in southern 
England. You look over a vast plain bounded by distant hills. At your feet is a 
deep escarpment clad with pines and firs and heather-clad slopes. Below in the 
valley of the <b>Blackwater</b> and beyond it rise the <b>Hartford Bridge Flats</b>, 
along which ran the old coaching road from <b>London to Southampton</b>, much 
loved by motorists. [P.9]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These Finchampstead Ridges benefit by a splendid road made 
by the late <b><a href="../families_john_walter_3.htm">Mr. John Walter</a></b>, 
proprietor of <b>The Times</b>, who has left an indelible mark upon this 
neighbourhood by his benefactions and his buildings; it finishes in a noble 
avenue, a mile in length, of <b>Wellingtonia pines</b>, fifty-five on each side, 
forming a grand approach to <b>Wellington College</b>. On these Ridges <b>King 
Henry VII</b> and his son, <b>Prince Arthur</b>, riding from <b>Easthampstead</b>, 
set out to meet <b>Katherine of Aragon</b> after her arrival in England to 
become the prince's bride. [p.10]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>To the west of Riseley: </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Though it has to pass through fields where all traces have 
vanished, we can conjecture its course by the names <b>Coldharbour Wood</b>, <b>
Stamford End</b>, where there was a ford over the <b>Loddon</b>, <b>Stratfield 
Saye</b>, <b>Stratfield Turgis</b>, and <b>Stratfield Mortimer</b>, the prefix
<b><i>strat</i></b> signifying street or paved way. [P.13]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>He quoted both <b>Chaucer</b> and <b>Shakespeare</b> on 
Windsor Forest, and named the location of <b>"Sir John Falstaff's Oak"</b>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chapter 2 - Forest Hunting:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>At Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park, he wrote:&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here the late <b>Prince Christian</b>, Ranger of Windsor Forest, 
lived for many years and won the hearts of all Berkshire folk. [P.22]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Barkham was central to the <b>
<a href="../memories_garth.htm">Garth Hunt</a></b>; but here, 
Peter described stag hunting:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Methods of hunting have changed through the ages. When the
<b>Royal Buckhounds</b> ceased to exist the carted deer continued in vogue, 
until the Great War began, with the <b>Berks and Bucks Farmers' Staghounds</b>. 
At an earlier period the stag was roused from his lair with blood hounds, or 
harboured by the huntsman or yeoman prickers on foot, and these fleeter dogs of 
the greyhound type were slipped from their leash for the chase. In <b>Queen 
Elizabeth's</b> time another method was practised. In <b>Norden's map of the 
Little Park</b> there is a building called the <b>"Standinge"</b>, which seems 
to have been designed for spectators to watch the pursuit and capture of the 
stag, and sometimes deer were driven past it and shot with arrows by privileged 
persons ensconced therein. Queen Bess often indulged in this not very 
sportsmanlike proceeding. [P.23]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But while they lived, the deer were the lords of the 
forest. Everything was done for their convenience and preservation. Some man who 
set up a windmill was compelled to take it down lest it should frighten the 
deer. [P.23]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" alt="Roe deer at Ellis Hill, Arborfield. Many deer can be seen in the Coombes" src  ="../images/new/deer_at_ellis_hill.jpg" width=623 height=427 ></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is no space for me to record all the lawless deeds 
done in our forest, the troubles of the <b>Civil War</b>, the slaughter of the 
deer, the gipsies and other wild people that dwelt in the woods and caught the 
poor stags with baited apples, the highwaymen who haunted our roads, the <b>
"Wokingham Blacks"</b>, to whose exploits I may again refer, and finally the 
enclosure of the forest lands and the vast changes wrought thereby which were by 
no means all good and beneficial.[P.25]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before we leave the actual forest and its story I must 
point out sundry bypaths and byways that intersect our district. They radiate 
like the spokes of a wheel from the Castle as the centre. There is one long road 
called the <b>Nine Mile Ride</b>, literally nine weary miles in length through 
the pine woods. These roads owe their origin in the first instance to <b>Queen 
Anne</b>, called "the Good." She had a passion for hunting, and, as <b>Dean 
Swift</b> records in his letter to Stella, she used to hunt the stag in summer 
through the meridian heat, and drove forty miles in one day. Many of them were 
completed by <b>George III </b>who in his later years could not ride a horse. I 
believe the Nine Mile Ride was made by him and ends lamely close to a 
brick-kiln. Malicious tongues often wag about royalties, and it has been said 
that he had this ride constructed in order to visit the fair Quakeress <b>Hannah 
Lightfoot</b>; but there is, I believe, no ground for this legendary scandal. 
[p.26]</p>

        <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chapter 3 - Binfield and Pope:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The old form of <i>Binfield</i> was <i>Benetfeld,</i> and
<i>henet</i> or <i>heonet</i> means a kind of coarse grass. From this lowly 
origin sprang this delightful village with its well-wooded and well-watered 
pastures, nigh the old road that runs from Reading to Windsor and thence to 
London. Two hundred years ago, and that was perhaps the period of its greatest 
fame, it was an attractive place, and since then many large houses have sprung 
into being, so much so that a former rector, who was somewhat partial to dining 
out, remarked that he had in his parish thirty-two "soup and fish houses". 
[P.28]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" alt="Binfield Church" src ="../images/new/PD_Binfield.jpg" width=619 height=401 >&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the erection of village churches in the days when 
transit was difficult our ancestors did not import Caen stone from Normandy, or 
even Purbeck marble, but contented themselves in this neighbourhood with the 
conglomerate "pudding stone" which they collected with infinite pains and labour 
when they broke up the " iron pan " of the surrounding heath country. The old 
squat tower of <b>Binfield church</b> is built of this. [P.29]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The late rector, <b>Canon Savory</b>, sent me one day some 
pieces of an inscribed brass which he had found in a cupboard in the rectory. I 
at once saw that this was a mutilated long-lost memorial. I consulted <b>Mr. 
Mill Stephenson</b>, F.S.A., the greatest authority in England on the subject, 
and the result was the restoration of the brass to the church. It was discovered 
to be an interesting palimpsest. After the period of the Reformation the 
brass-makers' shops were filled with old material, spoil from the destruction of 
the great monastic churches and from the suppression of chantry chapels; these 
pieces were worked up again into new memorials inscribed upon the reverse side. 
[P.30]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is noticeable that five tombstones are in memory of 
Roman Catholics who lived in the reign of Charles 11. One has the letters 
C.A.P.D., a disguised form of the favourite pre-Reformation prayer <i>Cujus 
Anima Propicietur Dens</i>. Evidently there was a colony of Roman Catholics at 
Binfield at the end of the seventeenth century, and amongst these were members 
of the <b>Dancastle</b> family. The last of the race died in 1780, "after 
patiently enduring the most excruciating pains of the gout without intermission 
for upwards of sixteen years", as a tablet to his memory in the church records. 
It was owing to two brothers, John and Thomas, scions of this house, that <b>
Alexander Pope</b>, the father of the poet, came to reside in the village, which 
thus became the home of the famous writer during his early years. [P.32-3]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pope described his home as :</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><b>My paternal cell <br>A little house with trees a-row,<br> And 
like its master very low.</b></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He tells how his father spent the time in gardening, and 
how he</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><b>Plants cauliflowers and boasts to rear <br>The earliest mellons of the year.</b></i> [P.33]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His Windsor Forest has been described as " a beautiful 
incongruity." He speaks of the</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><b>Inspiring shade, <br>Scene of my youthful loves and happy hours,</b></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yet he talks of the pines diffusing "a noxious shade," and 
of the "dreary desert," and the "gloomy waste," and finally </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><b>Crowns the forests with immortal greens. </b></i>[P.37]</p>

  <p class="sthead">

        <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chapter 4 - Wokingham, a Forest Town.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Having moved from Binfield to nearby Warfield, he says:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our faces are set towards the old Forest town of <b>Wokingham</b>, 
and here I may note the changed condition of the country. In former times it was 
wild and desolate, with long stretches of heath and few roads. Hence it was not 
difficult for travellers to lose their way at night time. So <b>Richard Palmer</b>, a 
good benefactor of Wokingham, in his Will dated April 12, 1664, bequeathed a 
rent-charge on a piece of land in the parish of <b>Eversley </b>for the purpose of 
paying the sexton to ring the greatest bell in the church for half-an-hour every 
evening at eight o'clock, and every morning at four o'clock, or as near those 
hours as might be, from the 10th of September to the 11th of March for ever. The 
object of this ringing was to encourage a timely going to rest in the evening 
and an early rising in the morning, and to be a timely and pious reminder of the 
hearers' latter end, inclining them to think of their own passing bell and day 
of death, while the morning bell reminded them of their resurrection and call to 
their last judgment, but also in order that strangers and others, who should 
happen in winter nights within hearing of the bell to lose their way in the 
country, might be informed of the time of night and receive some guidance into 
their right way. That bell is still rung in the evening, but not in the morning, 
though quite recently the benefaction was actually lost. [P.41-2]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We will not take the main and quickest road to our 
destination, but wander on from the cross-roads nigh the <b>"Stag and Hounds Inn"</b> 
to the <b>"Hare and Hounds Inn"</b>, a favourite meet of the <b>
<a href="../memories_garth.htm">Garth Hunt</a></b>, where a 
turning to the right leads to a beautiful park and house called <b>Billingbear</b>. 
Anciently the manor belonged to the <b>See of Winchester</b> and was surrendered to
<b>King Edward VI</b> in 1551, who granted it to <b>Henry Neville</b>, gentleman of the 
bedchamber. These Nevilles were an ancient and illustrious family. They held 
possessions in the Forest from Saxon days, and for hundreds of years were 
<b>"Keepers by inheritance"</b>. In addition to Billingbear they held the whole 
<b>Bailiwick of Fiennes</b>, an extensive district, including Bray, Winkfield, 
Bracknell and Wokingham, the manor of <b>Wargrave</b>, and Henry Neville was 
recommended by the King for Sheriff of Berkshire. [P.42]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Henry Neville was a staunch supporter of the New 
Learning and the Reformation, and rose to particular favour with Edward VI. When Mary 
came to the throne these grants were annulled, but under Queen Elizabeth he rose 
again into still higher favour, was knighted and restored to his estates. He was 
very zealous in persecuting <b>Recusants</b>, [P.42]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Soon the ancient forest town appears in sight. Modern houses 
and villas on the outskirts seem to dispute its claim to antiquity, but the view 
of the grand old church standing out from its encircling trees removes any 
doubts that might arise. Some years ago it narrowly escaped demolition, but was 
happily saved by the zeal of the parishioners. [P.44]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" alt="All Saints' Church from Rose Street" src ="../images/new/PD_Wokingham.jpg" width=627 height=409 ></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Leaving the church we pass along Rose Street, the oldest 
part of the town, with charmingly picturesque half-timbered sixteenth century 
cottages, and then reach the market place. The present unsightly <b>Victorian Town 
Hall</b>, erected in the 'sixties, took the place of an interesting earlier building 
with an undercroft, supported on pillars, wherein the business of the old 
municipal town was transacted. It is surrounded by some old houses. On the east 
next to the <b>"Bush Inn"</b> stood the <b>"Old Rose Inn"</b>, concerning which some stories 
are told. The present <b>"Rose Inn"</b>, a picturesque old building with its narrow 
passage into the inn-yard, not exactly adapted for a coach and four. It is a 
very charming old-fashioned hostelry, and much frequented in modern days. The old 
"Rose" on the east side of the market place had cause to blush on one occasion 
when some wits of the day, <b>Gay</b>, <b>Swift</b>, <b>Pope</b> and <b>Arbuthnot</b>, were detained there 
by the wet weather, and amused themselves by composing a song in praise of the 
charms of <b>Molly Mogg</b>, one of the daughters of the landlord, <b>John Mogg</b>. She had a 
sister named <b>Sally</b>, who was also a handsome beauty. Molly was much admired by 
the young squire of Arborfield, <b><a href="../families_Standen.htm">Edward Standen</a></b>; but she treated his attentions 
with scorn and refused to marry him. The wits, observing his melancholy manners, 
composed a poem in praise of Molly. Each poet contributed a verse as they sang 
of the disconsolate lover:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><b>His brains all lost in a fog <br> And nothing could give satisfaction 
<br> But thinking of sweet Molly Mogg.</b></i> [P.47-8]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Edward Standen</b> was the last of his race, and is always said 
to have pined away and died at the early age of twenty-seven. Every account of 
Wokingham records this supposed fact. It is unpleasant to be obliged to dispel 
illusions. However, I have studied the pedigree of the Standen family of 
Arborfield, and find that this Edward Standen married a lady named <b>Eleanor</b>, and 
therefore consoled himself after his youthful disappointment. He died 
childless. <b>Molly</b> lived to the age of sixty-seven and died unmarried. Some have 
supposed that <b>Sally</b> was the scornful and reluctant maid who won the affections 
of the young squire, but I refuse to dethrone Molly from her rightful place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(<b>Mr. Vincent</b> in his <b>Highways and Byways in Berkshire</b> is 
hopelessly muddled about Edward Standen, Miss Mitford and Molly Mogg. When Miss 
Mitford refers to the ruined state of the house about twenty years prior to her 
writing Our Village, she was telling the sad story of the Dawson family, not of 
the Standens. Mr. Vincent seems to have been in entire ignorance of the descent 
of the Manor, and of the Reeves and Dawsons who held it after the death of Mrs. 
Edward Standen. Edward Standen's Will is at Somerset House and was proved by his 
wife, sole executrix, April 7, 1731. One seldom finds so many errors in a single 
page as in Mr. Vincent's story.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>He then describes the blood-thirsty scene at the annual 
bull-baiting that lasted into the 1800s. [P48-9] and concludes with this 
anecdote: </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the close of the day, when drink had made men "full of 
quarrel and offence," there were disputes and fighting and rough horseplay, and 
in the Parish Registers there is a tell-tale entry, "Martha May, aged 55, who 
was hurt by fighters after Bullbaiting, was buried December 31, 1808," As early 
as 1801 a sermon was preached in the parish church of Wokingham on "Barbarity to 
God's dumb creation," containing a severe condemnation of the ancient practice, 
but it was not until St. Thomas's Day, 1832, that the last baiting took place. 
The bulls are still slaughtered, but in a more merciful fashion, and the meat 
given to the poor. [P.51]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Continuing the barbarous theme:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you go beneath the archway of <b>Mr. Sale's </b>shop which was 
formerly an inn, you will find at the end of the passage a footpath that bears 
the name <b>"Cock Walk"</b>, and in what is now a potato ground in former days was a 
famous Cock Pit. Here thousands of pounds were won and lost in backing the rival 
birds. Here the gentlemen of Berkshire and Hampshire had annual contests, and I 
have seen in the columns of the Reading Mercury, one of the oldest newspapers in 
the kingdom that still survives, advertisements of these contests with minute 
laws and regulations governing the sport. [P.51]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Moving on to justice:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As <b>Wokingham</b> was a Forest town, the <b>Forest Courts</b> were held 
there, or at <b>Windsor</b>, for the Berkshire portion. The justice of the Forest, or 
his deputy presided, and the inquisitions were made before him by the various 
Forest officials, such as the warden or chief forester, the foresters, verderers, 
regarders and free tenants. In the Public Record Office there are a large number 
of these inquisitions dating from 1363 to 1375. [P.52]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The origin of the name Wokingham is worth noting. A century 
ago the inhabitants thought that the name was connected with the oak tree, and 
spelt it <b>Oakingham</b>. In earlier maps it appeared as Okingham or Okyngham, but in 
its earliest form it is printed Wokingham (cf. Feudal Aids and Close Rolls). The 
prefix <b>Wokinga</b> is the Anglo-Saxon genitive, plural Woccinga, and means the sons 
of Woce, and ham in this case means "home"; hence the place-name means " the 
home of the Woccinga or sons of Woce, a Saxon settlement of a family which also 
left its name behind at Woking in Surrey. [P.53]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Leaving the <b>Town Hall</b> a pleasant footpath leads to
<b>Lucas's 
Hospita</b>l, a very charming building, consisting of a central portion and two 
wings, and founded by <b>Henry Lucas</b> by his will dated June 11, 1663. It was placed 
in the custody of the <b>Drapers' Company</b> of the City of London. The east wing is 
occupied by a chapel, the west wing by the master's lodging. There is 
accommodation for about fifteen old men to be selected from divers parishes in 
Berks and Surrey. The Hospital looks very calm and peaceful, especially on a 
summer's evening when the old men are sitting in front of their beautiful home. 
[P.55]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the <b>Broad Street</b> there are several good eighteenth 
century substantial houses with fine gardens at the back, and nearly opposite to 
<b>St. Paul's Church</b> there is an old manor house called the Beches. It takes its 
name from <b>Robert de la Beche,</b> who belonged to the old family of the de la Beches 
of Aldworth, who gave their name to Beach Hill [sic] near Mortimer. [P.56]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I must not pass over one other side in the life of the 
town, though it does not bring it much credit. It must be confessed that in 
times not very far remote we were rather a lawless lot. For generations, for 
centuries, the inhabitants of our forest have been deer-stealers, poachers, 
coney-catchers and trappers. Some of the elite of the profession of highwaymen 
have exercised their calling upon the borders of Berkshire and within the county 
itself. The great moor between Wokingham and Bagshot was the favouiite haunt of 
the owler, the footpad and the highwayman. [P.56]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Life in our country town is usually very peaceful and 
placid, but in recent years some building estates have been developed, and the 
old town hardly recognizes itself. However, it has not lost its calm or its 
charm, and there are many worse places that one might choose for one's home than 
the good old Forest town of Wokingham. [P.58-9]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chapter 5 - From Wokingham to Maidenhead</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Leave Wokingham by the northern by-lane opposite St. Paul's 
Church, a fine modern building erected by the late generous squire of Bear Wood, 
<b><a href="../families_john_walter_3.htm">Mr. John Walter</a></b>, his architect being
<b>Woodyer</b>. Passing <b>the Holt</b>, a much 
modernized seventeenth century house, and <b>Bill Hill</b>, the residence of the
<b>Leveson-Gower</b> family, and arrive at <b>Hurst</b>, a long, straggling, delightful 
village with a picturesque old church and almshouse. [P.60]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A remarkable feature of the old houses in the neighbourhood 
is the small extent of the estates which in olden times belonged to them. The 
probable reason of this is that the early occupants were connected with the 
court at Windsor, as secretaries, cofferers, etc., and the occupation was 
residential, not territorial; and these grants of estates being in the Forest, 
were not allowed to be large lest they should interfere with the hunting and the 
deer. [P.61]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The existence of so many places called <b>Hatches</b> shows the 
old internal boundaries of the Forest. [P.61]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A favourite name for inns in the Forest district is the <b>"Green Man"</b> — there is one in Hurst —where the greenclad foresters used to refresh 
themselves when they were hunting or minding the deer. [P.61]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Indications of former ownership by the Crown are sometimes 
discovered under the bark of trees when they have been cut down. I have seen the 
<b>marks of the royal crown</b> grown to a large size with the growth of the trees on 
some of the beeches, after they had fallen, in <b>Mr. Walter's Park at Bearwood</b>. 
[P.61]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>He describes the long history of the Castle Inn, formerly 
the Church Inn, and quotes from Aubrey as follows:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"In every parish was a church house, to which belonged 
spits, crocks, and other utensils for dressing provisions. Here the housekeepers 
met. The young people were there too, and had dancing, bowling, shooting at 
butts, etc., the ancients (i.e. the old folks) sitting gravely by, and looking 
on." [P.63]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From Hurst we could make our way to <b>Sonning</b>, one of the 
prettiest villages in England, situated on the Thames with an old bridge across 
the river. It is a very ancient place, and was the ecclesiastical centre of the 
district, as I have already remarked. It contained an episcopal palace where in 
mediaeval times the Bishops of Salisbury resided, and previous to the formation 
of the Sarum See the Bishops of Ramsbury and Sherborne who were sometimes styled 
Bishops of Sonning. [P.63]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Regarding the church building at <b>Ruscombe</b>: </i> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A local antiquary was once expatiating upon this tower and 
on the excellence of its architecture, and said, "The parishioners are very 
proud of this tower, seeing that it was built by a very famous architect whose 
initials are in the vane, C.R., <b>Christopher Ren</b>!" [P.64]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From 1710 to his death in 1718 <b>William Penn</b>, the founder of 
Pennsylvania, lived at Ruscombe, and thus brought undying fame to the village. 
The house in which he resided was pulled down by <b>General Leveson-Gower</b> in 1830. 
That was unfortunate. If it had been left standing and turned into a Penn 
museum, thousands of American pilgrims would have flocked to Ruscombe to worship 
at the shrine of their great countryman. [P.65]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We might continue our journey northward across open country 
to the pleasant river-side village of <b>Wargrave</b>, the old church of which fell a 
victim to the insensate rage of the suffragettes and was entirely burnt down 
just before the war. A fine new church has arisen from its ashes. [P.65]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But we will continue our present journey from Ruscombe in 
an easterly direction to <b>Waltham St. Lawrence</b>, where is the old <b>"Bell Inn"</b>, a 
coaching hostel, a fine gabled halftimbered building standing opposite the 
village pound and a much restored church, but it retains much that is 
interesting. [P.66]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Moving on past Shottesbrooke to White Waltham:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just outside the church 
wall the old stocks and whipping post remain, memorials of old-time punishments. 
[P.73]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Travelling two miles from White Waltham we are on 
<b>Maidenhead Thicket</b>, a famous ground for highwaymen and footpads. Stretches of 
beautiful common covered with gorse extend on each side the road. It was a tract 
so infested by robbers that as early as 1255 an order was issued for widening 
the road between Maidenhead Bridge and Henley-on-Thames, by removing the trees 
and brushwood on each side. [P.73-4]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That the thicket was a sufficiently dangerous locality, 
<b>Leland</b> shows in his account of his journey from Maidenhead to Twyford. For two 
miles the road was narrow and woody, dangerous enough; then came the <b>Great 
Frith</b> three miles long; altogether a wood infested with robbers five miles in 
extent. "And then", he says, "to <b>Twyford</b>, a praty tounlet a two miles." Twyford 
was undoubtedly a charming spot to reach after a route so long, tedious and 
dangerous. [P.74]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chapter 6 - Maidenhead and Bray</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">WE are told that <b>Maidenhead</b> cannot boast of a long or 
stirring history, and that it is but a child of its older neighbours, <b>Cookham</b>, 
<b>Bray</b> and <b>Taplow</b>. If so, it is a somewhat sturdy infant, and has thriven 
amazingly in recent years. [P.76]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The birth of Maidenhead may be attributed to the building 
of the bridge. Previous to its erection the <b>nearest crossing of the Thames</b> was 
by a ferry at <b>Balham</b>, and the great western road to Reading, Gloucester and 
Bristol went through <b>Cookham</b>. After the building of the bridge the traffic was 
diverted from Burnham and Cookham and caused Maidenhead to increase in 
prosperity and importance. Camden says that after the town " had built here a 
bridge upon piles it began to have inns, and to be so frequented as to out-vie 
its neighbouring mother, Bray, a much more ancient place". The first bridge was 
built about 1280, so that it can claim a long history. [P. 80]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Peter Ditchfield even criticised Camden's historical 
precision. Camden said that the bridge was built in 1460, but that there's 
documentary evidence that the bridge was repaired in 1297.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" alt="Maidenhead Bridge" src ="../images/new/PD_Maidenhead_Bridge.jpg" width=625 height=393 ></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As was not unusual in medieval times a chapel was connected 
with the bridge. Old bridges were rather perilous structures, and travellers 
would often wish to pray for a safe passage, or to give thanks for their secure 
crossing. [P.81]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is little of interest in modern Maidenhead to attract 
the attention of the lover of old buildings. Some old almshouses on the road to 
the river were erected in 1653. [P.83]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All the churches are modern. But those who love the river 
know well the town's attractions, and the charms of that fine reach within sight 
of the <b>Cliveden Woods</b> or <b>Burnham Beeches</b>, though their delights may be dimmed by 
the scramble through the famous and fashionable <b>Boulter's Lock</b>. [P.84]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The village [of Bray] will be associated in the minds of 
most readers with the turncoat vicar, whom Fuller describes as living in the 
reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth", first a Papist, then a 
Protestant, then a Papist, and then Protestant again. He had seen some martyrs 
burnt at Windsor, and found this fire too hot for his tender temper. This vicar 
being taxed by one with being a turncoat and an unconstant changeling: 'Not so,' 
said he, 'for I have always kept my principle, which is this, to live and die 
the Vicar of Bray.' Such many, nowadays, who, though they cannot turn the wind, 
turn their mills, and set them so that wheresoever it bloweth their grist shall 
certainly be grinded." [P.87]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Peter suggests that the traveller returns to a hostelry in Maidenhead for 
the night, which gives him a chance to relate an amusing story about the <b>"Bear"</b>, where 
<b>James I</b> dined with the <b>Vicar and Curate of Bray</b> unbeknown to them. For the punch-line, see P. 95]. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chapter 7 - From Maidenhead to Henley.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A PLEASING diversity in our methods of travel may be made 
by taking a boat at Maidenhead and traversing the old Berkshire highway, the 
river Thames. In summer the excursion can be made by the Thames steamboats which 
allow of landing at any lock and at frequent points elsewhere. In olden days 
before railways were invented and the system of canals extended, the Thames was 
the principal means for transit of goods and the great highway of traffic. In 
1205 King John gave licence to <b>William FitzAndrew</b> to have one vessel to ply on 
the river between Oxford and London, without any impediment to him or his men on 
the part of the bailiffs of Wallingford and Windsor, and all through time 
following the Thames has been thus used. In the time of Henry VIII both persons 
and goods were usually conveyed by boat from Windsor to London. "The quality" 
travelled by barges, their servants and goods by boat. [P. 95]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>The Thames has always been liable to flood, but he quoted 
a Dr. Plot who stated that in summer "in dry times barges do sometimes lie 
aground three weeks or a month or more". From Maidenhead, the voyage in a rowing-boat takes him 
past 'Cliefden' to <b>Cookham</b>, whose ancient church is described in "a long and 
interesting paper by Sir George Young" - an ancestor of the current MP.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The townlet has many attractive-looking Queen Anne houses 
and halftimbered tile-roofed cottages, but its old-world character has been lost 
in modem times, the motor-horn is heard continually in its streets, and crowds 
of excursionists from London invade this once retired village. [P.97]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Further upstream, past Bourne End and Little Marlow, he 
complains that Great Marlow has a "hideous modern church that took the place of 
a fine Gothic one in 1835". [P.98] On the other hand, upstream is: </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bisham Abbey</b> where we could linger with pleasure the 
whole length of a summer day. The beauty of the scenery and the historical 
associations of this monastic house and architectural charms, are delightful in 
the extreme.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Embarking again, another mile
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Hurley Priory" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/new/PD_Hurley_Priory.jpg" width="401" height="295">and a half brings us to 
another monastic institution, <b>Hurley Priory</b>, of which the vicar, the <b>Rev. F. T. Wethered</b>, is the able and learned historian. He has examined endless documents 
and his work is a mine of antiquarian lore. Few villages can rival Hurley in 
interest. It has a number of half-timbered cottages; the dovecote of the 
monastery, the remains of that institution including the church, and the 
historical associations of <b>Lady Place</b>, constitute an extraordinary number of 
special attractions, and the village is fortunate in possessing such an 
enthusiastic and able historian. [P. 101-2]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We embark again, and soon another monastery appears in 
sight upon the Bucks shore, the famous <b>Medmenham Abbey</b>, famous not only for its 
monastic establishment, but infamous, too, for the orgies of that mad company of 
pseudo-monks who carried on their revels here in the eighteenth century. 
[P.103-4]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fraternity was known as the <b>"Hell Fire Club"</b>. It is 
perhaps as well that most of their proceedings should be buried in oblivion. 
Their rites have been described as "Bacchic festivals. Devil worship, and a 
mockery of all the rites of religion". They slept in cradles, and one that 
belonged to <b>John Wilkes</b> is still in existence. They used to stay at Medmenham 
for a week and assemble twice a year. [P.105]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Of Henley, Peter says it used to have a castle, and 
continues:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An 
examination of the documents of the corporation, which date back to 1397, proves 
that <b>Henley</b> was at one time a <b>walled town</b>. It was situate in the kingdom of
<b>Mercia</b>, while the county of Berks on the other side of the river was in 
<b>Wessex</b>. 
No one has yet discovered how old the corporate life of Henley really is. The 
ledger book dates back to the reign of <b>Richard II</b> [P.107]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Henley has many hostelries which in time of peace when the 
Regattas used to be held, and during the long summer days when house-boats 
congregate on the Thames fair banks, are full of guests. Chief of them is the 
old "<b>Red Lion Hotel"</b>, which has a famous history. It was an old coaching inn; 
into its yard in the palmy days of coach-traffic a score of these vehicles drove 
every day. [P.109]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We return to our Forest town, Wokingham, through Wargrave 
and Twyford, and after a good night's rest at the <b>"Rose"</b> we will start again on
