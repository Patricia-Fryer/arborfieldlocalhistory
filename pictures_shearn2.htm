mid-1960's, and he recorded the state of the village at that time. Take a stroll

Gardens</b> was built in three phases. The first 
was prior to 1961, down to the footpath that runs alongside the Village Shop and 
out towards Arborfield Court. <br><br>An aerial photo from this time clearly shows the 
footpath and a field behind Arborfield Stores, which soon afterwards was covered by the 'new houses' - 
six pairs of semi-detached 
chalet-style and one detached. This photo is taken from 
just beyond one of the 'new houses', No. 43, looking up the hill. When the road was extended in 1963, the 
inlet shown here was removed, because there was no need to turn round. </p> 
       
      
<p class="stbody">These photos of <b>Melrose Gardens </b>were taken in 1973, 
when the road had been extended to join <b>Swallowfield Road</b>.&nbsp; The 
Parish Council had fought hard to reduce the density of the housing on the 
so-called 'Chamberlain's Estate', and had insisted that the road was diverted so 
that that there wasn't a straight run to the bottom of the hill, no doubt to the 
relief of the new residents. Those who lived there at that time can surely 
recall the sound of motor-bikes then highly popular with teenagers. Eventually, 
the road was converted into a cul-de-sac when a new pair of semi-detached houses 
was built across the entrance to Swallowfield Road. this new house is 
asymmetrical; one part is much wider than the other, no doubt to fit into the 
available space. Follow the road as it used to look, gradually working up the 
hill.</p>

<p class="stbody">In this view, looking down the hill from No. 43, the bend in 
the road can clearly be seen. Since the early 1970's, a Sycamore tree has 
completely changed the outlook, obscuring the road further down. In any event, 
the later semi-detached house built across the exit to Swallowfield Road has 
itself obscured the view of the Park.&nbsp; </p>
