By 1589, <b>Thomas Bullock</b> found it necessary to sell the manors of Arborfield and 
Barkham to <b>Edmund Standen</b>, who was a Clerk of the Petty Bag of the Court of 
Chancery. This sale was contested by the Bullock family - click <b>
<a href="families_bullock_standen.htm">here</a></b> for more details.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Edmund Standen</b> died in March 1603, the year the Jacobean manor 
was built, to be succeeded by his son <b>William</b>, who lived at Arborfield 
Manor with his wife <b>Mary</b> until his death in 1637.&nbsp; In 1615 Sir 
William was Sheriff of the County of Berkshire. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">In 'Barkham: A History', it states that William died 
childless, and his heir-at-law was a kinsman called <b>William Ball</b>, who was 
the grandson of Edmund Standen's second brother. The Arborfield and Barkham 
estates passed instead under a family settlement to another kinsman of the same 
name, <b>William Standen</b>, who was the grandson of Edmund Standen's fifth 
brother.&nbsp; William Standen (kinsman) and his wife <b>Sarah</b> lived at the 
mansion house at the Barkham Manor site, while <b>Mary Standen</b>, widow,&nbsp; 
continued to live at Arborfield until her death in 1645. William and Sarah then 
moved to Arborfield while his kinsman William Ball took up residence at Barkham. 
William Standen was High Sheriff at Berkshire in 1648, and at some time was a 
member of the Barber Surgeons' Company in the City of London.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Mary Standen</b> was the daughter of <b>Samuel and 
Elizabeth Backhouse</b> of Swallowfield House. There is a considerable amount of 
information about the Backhouse family in <b>'Swallowfield and its Owners'</b>, 
written by <b>Constance Russell</b>, wife of <b>Sir George Russell, M.P. for 
Wokingham</b>, in 1901. This interesting book is freely available to download on 
the Web.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>William Standen</b> died in 1686, the Manors passed to his 
son John. When <b>John Standen</b> died in 1694, he was succeeded by <b>Edward 
Standen</b>, who may have been either the eldest son of John Standen or his 
third brother. Edward Standen's son 
<b>Edward</b> has been immortalised in the 'Ballad of Molly Mogg', as related in 
this tale:<br>
<br>
“The Rose Inn at Wokingham was kept by a man called Mogg, who had two very 
pretty daughters, Molly and Sally. Edward Standen fell in love with Molly, who 
would have nothing to say to him: he was very attentive and one day, kept at the 
Inn “by the weather”, three poets from Binfield, <b>Pope</b>, <b>Gay</b> and <b>Arbuthnot</b>, 
happened to see him with Molly, and noticed his “melancholy manner”. So they 
composed a poem in her praise, each contributing a verse. About Edward they 
wrote:<br>
<br>
<b><i>His brains all lost in a fog<br>
And nothing could give satisfaction<br>
But thinking of sweet Molly Mogg”</i></b><br>
<br>
Molly lived to be 76 and died unmarried. Edward instead married a lady called 
“Eleanor”. They had no children and he died aged 27 years in 1730, 
therefore Arborfield House passed to a cousin, one Richard Aldworth, but being a 
minor, his guardian sold it under an Act of Parliament to Pelsant Reeves of 
Yorkshire.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Richard Aldworth also owned Stanlake Park, near Twyford, and 
Billingbear Park, near Wokingham; he was father to the first Lord Braybrooke 
(who was raised to the peerage in 1797). </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The Standen family held the right of Patronage to the parishes 
of both Arborfield and Barkham, and in 1640 they presented the then rector of 
Barkham, <b>Stephen Rose</b>, to the living at Arborfield. We don't know how 
long he stayed in both positions because there are few records surviving from 
the period of the Civil War (1642 - 1646) and the Commonwealth (1649 - 1660).&nbsp; 
At the end of this period, Alexander Stokes was presented as Rector of both 
Barkham and Arborfield by <b>William Standen</b> and his kinsman <b>William Ball</b>.&nbsp; 
In the book 'Barkham: A History', we learn from the Hearth Tax Returns that 
Alexander Stokes lived at Barkham from 1662 to 1664, and that there were four 
fireplaces at the parsonage house. However, he later moved to the rectory at 
Arborfield.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The next Rector, <b>John Sale</b>, was presented to both 
parishes in 1694. In 'Barkham: A History', David French states that Sale was not 
presented by the Lord of the Manor, <b>Edward Standen</b>, but by <b>Samuel Sale</b>, 
merchant, to whom the right to make the next presentation appears to have been 
leased by Edward Standen.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b>Standen Tomb</b> can be seen in Arborfield Church; it 
was moved from the old church in 1939. Here are some views of the tomb, with a 
translation of the plaque on the tomb and the plaque on the west wall of the 
church.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reading Local Studies Library</b> has an engraving 
  showing the Standen Tomb when it was in the old church in around 1842. Its 
  web-site describes the engraving as follows: 'The tomb of Sir William Standen, 
  who died in 1639, and Maria, his wife. The monument was later moved to the new 
  church, on a different site. Print, drawn by E. J. Niemann, and engraved by S. 
  Williams, from "The Environs of Reading" by J. G. Robertson, published in 
  1843'. You can see the engraving by clicking <b>
  <a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1265214.PDF">here</a></b>. 
Note that the husband was on the right on the engraving, whereas he is now on 
the left. Also, the young daughter is now facing away from her parents, whereas 
before she was facing towards them, obscuring the skull on which she rests.</p>
