        <b><span style="font-weight: 400">RAF aerial photo of Lower 
        Arborfield and Shinfield, dated 
        10th March 1946, ref.  4042, reproduced by permission of </span></b>

        <b>National Monuments Record, English Heritage. </b></p>

        <p class="stbody">
        The Shinfield side of the River Loddon seems to have escaped the 
        heaviest Army activity. However, in this close-up, it looks as if there 
        might have been a firing range half-way up the left-hand side. Cutbush 
        Lane cuts across from the mid-left to the top; this was a through route 
        until the M4 motorway was built around 1970, just to the north of this 
        close-up.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        The motorway was first mentioned in Berkshire County Council Minutes in 
        1946, when it appeared in the Abercrombie Plan for Greater London as 
        'Route 2: London and South Wales via Severn Bridge'. During Summer 1946, 
        Wokingham Rural District Council found out that the 'A4 Trunk Road' was 
        planned to pass through Winnersh and Shinfield when its King Street Lane 
        Council housing site had to be reduced in size to allow for the planned 
        route alignment. This housing site later became Allnatt Avenue.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Later that year, on 25th September, Berkshire County Council's Highways 
        and Bridges Committee was told: </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <i>‘The County Surveyor reported that the Minister of Transport proposed 
        to seek power to construct <b>‘motor roads’</b>, the essential features 
        of which would be that the roads would be restricted to motor traffic 
        only, and that access would be obtainable at only a relatively few 
        points. If such powers were granted the Ministry would be likely to 
        propose that Maidenhead By-Pass should be a motor road and that 
        branching from that road there should be a motor road passing westwards 
        across the County south of Reading and Newbury, the latter forming part 
        of the suggested London – South Wales motor road.</i></p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <i>‘At the request of the Divisional Road Engineer detailed plans were 
        being prepared for the construction of the Maidenhead By-Pass as a motor 
        road, and investigations were proceeding for the location of the London 
        – South Wales road through Berkshire.</i></p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <i>‘The Ministry regard the preparation of plans for Maidenhead By-Pass 
        as being a matter of urgency since this project would be given a high 
        priority when labour becomes available to carry out major trunk road 
        improvement schemes. Maps showing the tentative proposals for the motor 
        roads in the County were exhibited at the Meeting’</i>.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        This Committee was presented with a long list of by-passes at its 
        October 1946 meeting, and it included the London – South Wales Motor 
        Road, crossing the A329 at Winnersh, the A327 at Shinfield, the A33 at 
        Grazeley, then Burghfield and Mortimer, crossing the border into 
        Hampshire and back again, and continuing west past Kintbury and south of 
        Hungerford. However, by the 1960's the 
        planned route of the M4 was much further to the north, passing through 
        south Oxfordshire before reaching Swindon. A last-minute change of plan 
        saw it revert to a route through Berkshire, but now passing north of 
        Newbury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        In the aerial photo above, note the shadows cast by the two posts in the 
        lower&nbsp; right-hand corner; we can judge what time of the day the 
        photo was taken - fairly early in the morning.</p>
