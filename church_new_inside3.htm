  window is of three lights with a smaller light above. In the small light is an 
  angel holding a scroll with the words: Alleluia Alleluia.</p>
  <p>In the lower lights: Faith, Charity, Hope.</p>
  <p>Below: To the glory of God and in memory of Washington and Anna Maria 
  Dawson Jackson this window is placed by their loving children September 29<sup>th</sup> 
  1880.</p>
  <p>At the east end of the chancel which is apsidal are three single lancet 
  windows; that in the north east shows an angel with hands clasped in prayer. 
  Below the words: In loving memory of Stuart Hamilton Rickman Captain Royal 
  Navy Born Nov 23<sup>rd</sup> 1843 Died May 7<sup>th</sup> 1913. </p>
  <p>Mid east: Shows our Saviour with hands upraised &amp; standing above a city. In

  <p>South east: Represents an angel kneeling with arms folded across her 
  breast. Below in the glass: In loving memory of Ellen Ann Simonds Born Aug 18<sup>th</sup> 
  1846, Died Dec 9<sup>th</sup> 1896.</p>
  <p>Within the altar rails on the south side of the chancel in a double lancet 
  window with wide splay. The one on the east side represents Our Lord with Lamb 
  &amp; Flag.</p>
  <p>Above the figures: He giveth his beloved sleep.</p>

  on the east side and the "Good Samaritan" on the west.</p>
  <p>There is no brass or wording in the glass denoting to whose memory this 
  window is erected.</p>
  <p>The fourth window is a single lancet and it was made specially to fit some 
  stained glass brought from the old church. Most of it was [illegible] but only 
  this one portion placed in this window which shows the head of our Saviour 
  bearded and wearing a mitre, was saved, all the remainder being broken. The 
  colouring in the glass is very fine.</p>
  <p>[This is now known to be ‘Aaron’s Head’]</p>
  <p>There are four windows on the north side of the nave, all of double light, 
  the second and third from the chancel end are coloured, the others plain.</p>
