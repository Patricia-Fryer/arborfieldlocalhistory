		near Southampton in 
		July 1870, and made his mark on the village very quickly. He endeared 
		himself to the local people by a very generous donation of a new 
		building, sometimes known as the <strong>Institute</strong>, as described below. 
		Note that this was almost six years before <strong>Arborfield</strong> 
		gained its own <strong><a href="properties_Reading_Room.htm">Reading

	  PRESENTATIONS.</b> </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Two very gratifying 
	  presentations were made at the <b>Reading Room</b> on Thursday evening, 
	  viz., a very handsomely bound reference Bible to <strong>Mrs. Warriner</strong>, from the 
	  children, teachers, and friends of the Union Chapel, Horton-Heath, as a 
	  slight token of their gratitude for hospitality and kindness bestowed on 
	  them, and the other to <strong>Captain Hargreaves</strong>, who has generously built the 
	  Reading Room, and, together with its well-stocked library, handed it over 
	  for the use of the inhabitants. The testimonial to the gallant captain 
	  consisted of an address, beautifully illuminated by Mr. J. Leach, of 
	  Southampton, as follows:- </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><em>“</em><strong><em>To Captain 
	  Hargreaves, The Mount, Bishopstoke.</em></strong><em> We, the members of the 
	  Bishopstoke Reading Room and Library, desire to record our grateful thanks 
	  for the munificent gift you have made us and this neighbourhood, by the 
	  erection of a spacious and convenient reading room and the well-stocked 
	  library you have established. We acknowledge the immense boon that this 
	  institute is to us, and trust that we shall so use it that we may reap the 
	  great use it is calculated to impart, and prove to you our true 
	  appreciation of your gift. Wishing you and yours every blessing, and that 
	  your efforts to benefit others may bring to yourself a rich reward, we 
	  are, on behalf of the members, Stephen Hobbs, John Mason, James Herridge, 
	  William Chamberlain Dummer, Henry Herridge, Charles A. Laishley, George 
	  Forty, Thomas Winzar, committee.” </em> </p>
		<p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mrs. Warriner and Captain Hargreaves 
	  suitably acknowledged the presentations, and during the evening a vocal 
	  and instrumental entertainment was given, the proceedings closing with the 
	  National Anthem. </p>

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On Wednesday evening the 
	  members of the <strong>reading room and library</strong> were favoured 
	  with a visit from Mr. Mason, of Canal-walk, Southampton, who exhibited a 
	  large number of dissolving views, which afforded great satisfaction. 
	  </p>
		<p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">During the evening, Mr. Warriner gave some first-rate songs, which were 
	  much appreciated by the audience, each song receiving an <i>encore</i>. It 
	  is hoped the members will be favoured with another visit from Mr. Warriner 
	  during his stay in the neighbourhood. <strong>Captain Hargreaves kindly 
	  gave the members the loan of one of his capital musical boxes, which 
	  played during he evening, and was greatly admired</strong>. At 6 o'clock, 
	  by special arrangement, the children of the members were admitted free to 
	  the room, when Mr. Mason gave a selection of views, which were much 
	  appreciated. At the close each child was presented with a bun and an 
	  orange, and before leaving the room gave several rounds of cheers to the 
	  lady who had favoured them with such an excellent treat. About 120 
	  children were present. <strong>Thanks were voted to Captain Hargreaves and Messrs. 
	  Warriner and Mason</strong>.</p>
		<p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">[NOTE: The 'Mr. Warriner' 
		was most likely Mrs. Warriner's son Emile, born in Cheltenham, and who 
		was now 19 years old.] </p>
