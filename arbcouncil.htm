<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Until 1927,&nbsp; all affairs were 
conducted by <b>Parish Meetings</b> rather than a Parish Council, mainly chaired 
by <b><a href="C20/families_Anderson.htm">Canon Joshua Anderson</a></b>, Rector 
of St. Bartholomew's, Arborfield.&nbsp;  </span></p>

<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">It took a 
crisis to put the civil parish onto a more formal footing, when finances became insufficient to cover repairs to the 
six Parish Cottages because the two main revenue-earners -&nbsp; Arborfield Hall and 
Arborfield Grange - were unoccupied&nbsp; (and therefore not liable for Poor Rate)&nbsp; 
for 6 months.&nbsp; Following this,&nbsp; it was proposed to set up a Parish Council,&nbsp;&nbsp;and permission was then granted by Berkshire County Council.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The first election on 8th July 1927 
produced 8 candidates:  </span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Elizabeth Marion Prescott</b>*, <br><b>Guthrie Allsebrook</b>* 
(Arborfield Hall), <br><b>Arthur James Aldridge</b>, <br><b>John Gutteridge</b>, <br>
<b>Margaret Hay</b>, <br><b>John 
Provan Jackson</b>*, <br><b>Charles Rogers</b>* (White's Farm) and <br><b>Charles Walter Crocker</b>* 
(Cross Lanes Farm);<br><br>- the asterisks (*) show those elected on a show of hands.&nbsp; Even after this 
time,&nbsp; <b>Canon Anderson</b> remained chairman of the <b>Annual Parish 
Meetings</b>.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Meetings had been held at the Arborfield 
and Barkham School Rooms to 1911,&nbsp; and at Arborfield Grange on 26th October 1911.
</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="en-gb">Here are some gleanings from the Meeting Minutes over 
the years, showing what was important in village life at the time.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Housing</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Click <b>
<a href="parishcottages.htm">here</a></b>&nbsp;for a separate article on the Parish's 
six houses.</span></p>
<p class="stbody">Canon Anderson proposed at the 1919 Annual Parish Meeting 
"That this Meeting is of the opinion that additional houses for working people 
are required in this Parish", and the motion was forwarded to Wokingham Rural 
District Council [WRDC]. Eventually, WRDC built 32 Council Houses near the 
Bramshill Hunt on Eversley Road (much more recently known as Rickman Close and 
Bramshill Close).<span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Gas Supply</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The Aldershot Gas, Water and District 
Lighting Co. proposed in 1918 to promote a Bill to extend its gas area to 
include the parishes of Winnersh, Newland, Barkham, Arborfield, Swallowfield and 
Shinfield (detached).&nbsp; That year's annual meeting could not decide whether this 
would benefit the Parish.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Electricity Supply</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The Thames Valley Electricity Supply 
Co. proposed to supply the village in 1937;&nbsp; action was delayed because BCC and 
the WRDC insisted that a large part of the cable be underground. In the event, 
electricity was not supplied until after the War. </span></p>
<p class="sthead"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Water Supply</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1926, Wokingham R.D.C. proposed a 
Water Supply Scheme.&nbsp; A public enquiry was held in Hurst, with strong opposition 
shown at the meeting to the scheme.&nbsp; Mr Bowyer, who had attended this meeting,&nbsp; 
was of the opinion that the matter would be dropped by the Rural District 
Council.</span></p>
<p class="sthead"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Postal Service</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1933, Mr Barker reported that he 
had petitioned the Postmaster at Reading for a Post Box near the "Bramshill" 
public house,&nbsp; there being 40 houses within 600 yards.&nbsp; Most of these were 
Council Houses provided by Wokingham Rural District Council.</span></p>
<p class="sthead"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Footpaths and Stiles</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1898,&nbsp; repairs to the fence and 
gate and the gravelling of the foot path through the field leading to the church 
cost £5/19/6.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In November 1919, the Chairman, Mr 
Kenneth Prescott of Arborfield Court,&nbsp; offered to withdraw while the Parish 
Meeting discussed an application from him.&nbsp; John Simonds was present and voted.&nbsp; 
It was proposed that there should be a diversion, turning and stopping up of a 
footpath leading out of the SE side of the high road from Arborfield Cross to 
Swallowfield at a point adjacent to Chamberlain's Farm and running in a 
southerly direction along the SE side of Arborfield Court into a lane known as 
Wokingham Lane.&nbsp; This was agreed to, after the plans were made publicly 
available for viewing in the Rectory from 5 to 7 pm every weekday for 2 months.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The 1919 meeting also heard about the 
dangerous state of the stile near Mr Harrington's cottage&nbsp; (owned by Mrs. Hart).
</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Stiles over the footpath through 
Chamberlain's Farm were in bad repair in 1923; also that near Bridge Cottages in 
1924. </span></p>
<p class="sthead"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Small Holdings and 
Allotments</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">1925 - Allotments circular received - decided 
in 1926 that there was no demand.</span></p>
<p class="sthead"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">Pond</font></span></b></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1911, the pond was cleaned out, and 
the mud deposited in the Occupation of Mr D Lucas.</span></p>
<p class="sthead"><font size="4">Councillors and Overseers</font></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">From 1894, the Chairman was <b>Captain 
Stuart Rickman</b>, who died in office in 1913. His successor for many years was the 
Rector, <b>Rev. Joshua Anderson</b>, but <b>Kenneth Prescott</b> of Arborfield Court chaired 
meetings between 1918 and 1923.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="en-gb">Overseers from 1894 to 1901 were <b>John 
Michael Wells</b> and <b>Richard Mallam Wells</b>. John was succeeded by <b>Andrew Nash</b> in 
1902, then <b>Francis Holliday</b> in 1903 and A<b>lfred Ebenezer Scrivener</b> in 1904.
</span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<b>Richard Wells</b> handed over to <b>Douglas Parfitt</b> in 1907.&nbsp; 
<b>Alfred Scrivever</b> stood down in 1918 for a year when<b> George A Keasley</b> of 
Arborfield Hall Farm took over, but returned to office in 1919. He then retired 
due to age and ill-health in 1923. <b>Charles Walter Crocker</b> took over for a year, 
followed by <b>Charles Lewis Hewett</b>. <b>Douglas Parfitt </b>handed over to 
<b>Stanley 
Thurston Hoskins </b>in 1919, who in turn was replaced the same year by <b>Joseph Bushell.
</b> </span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="en-gb">After the Parish Council had been elected 
in 1927, </span><span lang="EN-GB">one year later <b>Canon Anderson</b> replaced
<b>John Jackson</b> , and the same representatives served for another decade 
until <b>Guthrie Allsebrook</b> took over as Chairman in 1937. </span>
<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp;</span></p>
<font size="4"><b>
<p>The Second World War</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="left" class="stbody">By 1939, there was talk of war. Provision had 
already been made during the "Crisis in October 1938" for housing or finding 
accommodation for a large number of children who might be evacuated from the 
towns to the country at a few hours' notice, and the Councillors had all 
attended a special meeting in preparation. Meanwhile, the perennial cesspool 
issue had been referred to the R.D.C., who had offered to provide a <b>"Wet 
Scavenging Scheme" </b>for Arborfield. First mention was made of a proposed <b>
Playing Field</b>, considered most likely to be behind Pond Cottages. </p>
<p align="left" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="left" class="stbody">The 1940 meeting began, not with mention of 
the War, but that the Old Churchyard had never been in a better or more tidy 
condition in recent years than now [parts of the old church, including the 
Standen Tomb, the Altar Rail and the old wooden font, had recently been moved 
into the Victorian church]. The Parish was trying to get a <b>speed limit</b> 
through the village. The only military connection was reported by Mr. Barker, 
that an Army lorry had knocked down the notice board near the "Bramshill Hunt".
<b>Cesspits</b> were again mentioned, namely the one from <b>the Pheasantries</b>, 
which was leaking into the ditch in Church Lane <b>"causing an unbearable 
stench"</b>.</p>
<p align="left" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="left" class="stbody">There was no meeting in 1941, but in 1942 the 
War was mentioned at last. <b>Mrs Jervoise of Targett's Farm</b>, the A.R.P. 
Warden, had purchased bandages, gauze and cotton wool from Messrs. Boots &amp; Co. 
in Wokingham for dressing wounds.</p>
<p align="left" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="left" class="stbody">In 1943, <b>Mr Lee of Newland Farm</b> raised 
the subject of the Dug-Out just off the Reading Road, while <b>Mr Watts</b> 
complained that the road near his cottage was being cut away by heavy traffic.</p>
<p align="left" class="stbody"></p>
<font size="2">
<p class="stbody" align="left">The state of the Dug-Out was discussed again at the next 
meeting, in 1945. The roof was falling in, and boys were playing there. 
Representation was obviously a hot local issue. <b>Mrs More</b> of the Nurseries 
[in Swallowfield Road] enquired who was the District Councillor, and asked for 
two District Councillors in future, one for Arborfield and one for Newland. 
Because she was not a registered Elector, the Clerk stopped her from speaking, 
whereupon the District Councillor <b>Mrs. Capper </b>took up the issue, which 
was carried unanimously.</p>
</font><font size="4"><b>
<p>Post-War</p>
</b></font>
<p align="left" class="stbody">The <b>Greensward Lane cottages</b> needed to be 
re-thatched in 1946, exhausting Parish reserves. Bus times were an issue, the 6 
o'clock from Reading needing to be duplicated, and the morning services to 
Reading needing an extra service between 8:51 and 10:25. It was hoped that the 
bus company would provide shelters at the Cross and at the end of Church Lane. 
Extra policing was also called for, there having been a spate of thefts prior to 
Christmas 1945.</p>
<p class="stbody">The <b>Village Hall</b> replaced the School as a venue for the first 
time in March 1947, when the two Parishes held a joint meeting under the 
chairmanship of <b>Brigadier E. W. Chadwick</b>, with 21 present. They discussed 
a possible amalgamation, though the <b>Newland Charities</b> might cause difficulties 
because they would not cover residents of Arborfield. It was reported that the 
Military Authorities planned to buy the whole of <b>Arborfield Court Estate</b>; 
if this occurred, the Councils were anxious to preserve the footpath and the 
woodland. More generally, there was concern over the general state of roads and 
footpaths, the removal of barbed wire at Arborfield Cross, and the filling-in of 
the Pond at the Cross. Electricity was on the way, and the telephone kiosk was 
wired for electric light, ready for connection.<span lang="en-gb"> </span></p>
