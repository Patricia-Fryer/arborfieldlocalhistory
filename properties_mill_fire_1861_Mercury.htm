        <p class="stbody">There are three known newspaper articles on fires at 
        Arborfield Mill. This is from the 'Reading Mercury' on 28th September 
        1861.</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><font size="4">DESTRUCTION OF ARBORFIELD PAPER 
        MILLS BY FIRE</font></b><br>
        <br>
        At about two o’ clock in the morning of Tuesday last (24th September 
        1861), a fire broke out at the Paper Mills, Arborfield, occupied by <b>
        Mr. A. Towgood</b> which, we regret to say, quickly reduced the premises 
        to ruins. From what we can learn it appears that a man, named <b>Ford</b>, 
        remained on the premises on Monday night to keep up the fire, and at the 
        above hour he was surprised by a roaring noise in the upper part of the 
        building, at the north end, and on going thither he discovered a body of 
        fire in the top drying room, an apartment 100 feet long and 20 wide. He 
        at once hurried down stairs and immediately aroused <b>Mr. Gwynne</b>, 
        the manager who resided near, and a alarm was also given to the owner of 
        the mill, <b>T. Hargreaves, Esq</b>., who with other residents in the 
        village went to the spot without delay, and used every exertion to check 
        the progress of the flames, but, unfortunately, they extended with 
        fearful rapidity along the building, and within an hour the destruction 
        of the whole was certain. </p>

        <p class="stbody">The boiler contained a considerable quantity of water, 
        and the fire, which was threatening to ignite all around it, must have 
        generated steam that would doubtless have caused a terrific explosion, 
        but Mr. Gwynne courageously rushed to the spot, and removed the safety 
        valves, thus allowing the steam to escape. This praiseworthy act was, of 
        course, attended with great risk, and was performed in the face of 
        entreaties to the contrary. </p>

        <p class="stbody">The engines at Reading and the one at Wokingham were 
        sent for, and three arrived at about five o’clock, but nothing could 
        then be saved. The engines would have been present earlier had not the 
        horse, on which one of the messengers rode, been restive to such an 
        extent that it ran for some distance in a wrong direction. <br>
        <br>
        The mills were built of brick and timber, and during the past twelve 
        month a considerable sum had been expended: a new 20-horse power engine 
        and a quantity of new machinery having been fitted up, while other 
        portions were renovated: and it is stated that there was not a mill in 
        the country in better condition. </p>

        <p class="stbody">The paper made at the mills was strong brown, of a 
        peculiar description and there was, as usual, a large stock on the 
        premises. <b>Supt. O’Neill</b>, of the Wokingham Division, and <b>Supt. 
        Crook</b>, of the Reading Division, reached the place at an early hour, 
        and with several constables rendered all the aid in their power. </p>

        <p class="stbody">The man, Ford, with much forethought and 
        praiseworthiness, proceeded without loss of time to Mr. Hargreaves’ and 
        cautioned the men to carefully watch the ricks, the sparks from the fire 
        being carried in that direction. The property is, we hear, insured in 
        the “Atlas” Fire Office. The cause of the conflagration has not been 
        ascertained.<br>
