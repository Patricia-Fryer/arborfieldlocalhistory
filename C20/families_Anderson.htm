<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">After a short retirement in Boscombe,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">His impending retirement was announced 
by his churchwardens J. H. Simonds and W. J. Verrall in a letter to the 'Reading 
Mercury' as follows:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><i><b>Sir – Canon J. A. Anderson has intimated his intention of retiring 
after 48 years as Rector of Arborfield, and it is felt that his many friends, 
both in the parish and elsewhere, would wish to mark their appreciation of his

in some tangible way.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>At a general meeting held in Arborfield on July 27<sup>th</sup> it was 
decided to make an appeal both to the present parishioners and to past residents 
and the many friends the Canon has made both as Rector of the parish and also 
during his time as Rural Dean. It is desired to give him some personal present 
which he can take with him to his new home in Boscombe, also to renovate and 
improve the east end of the church as a lasting memorial of his long ministry.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Any contributions should be sent to Mrs. Prescott, of Arborfield Court, 
who is hon. treasurer of the Appeal Fund, or to either churchwarden.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Yours faithfully, </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>JOHN H. SIMONDS, W. J. VERRALL (Churchwardens of Arborfield).</b></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The 'Mercury' then reported the presentation made to Canon 
Anderson in its 6th October edition:</p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="3">PRESENTATION TO RECTOR
</font></b></p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">Canon J. A. Anderson, rector of Arborfield for 47 years, 
leaves the village next week, and will live at Boscombe. </p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">At a meeting held at the Village Hall, Canon Anderson was 
presented with a wireless set by <b>Mr. Stephen Emblen</b>, one of his oldest 
parishioners. </p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mr. W. J. Verrall</b>, <b>Mrs. Vickers</b> and <b>Mr. A. 
Garrett</b> spoke of Canon Anderson’s work in the parish and wished him well on 
his retirement. </p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">Canon Anderson, in reply, referred to the lot of 
encouragement he had had, not just from the leading residents but from all 
sections of the community. In his church activities, he has had the support of a 
loyal band of helpers who had given ungrudgingly of their time and often of 
their money. When he first came to the village he had only intended to stay a 
few years, but in fact he almost equalled the tenure of his immediate 
predecessors, and he never regretted it. </p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">Canon Anderson has also been presented with a walking stick 
by the Sunday School children, and a pair of book-ends by the scholars of the 
Church Schools. It is understood that the <b>Rev. W. F. Buttle</b>, patron of 
the living, will officiate at the services in October, until a successor is 
appointed.</p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">Soon afterwards, on 24th November, we read in the 'Mercury' 
on the planned Memorial for the Church: </p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="3">MEMORIAL TO RECTOR</font></b></p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">At a meeting of parishioners, held at the Village Hall on 
Monday, <b>Mr. Etchells</b>, the diocesan architect, made certain suggestions 
for improvements to the church which would form the basis of a memorial to the 
former rector, Canon J. A. Anderson. On the proposition of Mr. J. H. Simonds, in 
the chair, the meeting unanimously decided to apply for a Faculty to install a 
new organ and the choir seats at the west end of the church; to enlarge the 
vestry; and to carry out other alterations to the chancel and the nave, which 
would add to the general amenities of the church. </p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">[A later correction pointed out that Mr Etchells was not 
the Diocesan Architect]</p>

        <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">Canon Anderson returned to Arborfield for Holy Week and 
Easter 1946 during the inter-regnum before Claude Sparshott took over in October 
that year, as noted in the 'Register of Services'. </p>
       
<p class="MsoNormal">The Register of Services also records his burial at 
Arborfield on 8th November 1947 as follows: 'Joshua Alexander Anderson, Rector 
of Arborfield 1898 - 1945; died 5th November. Service conducted by the Bishop of 
Reading, Canon Winter, Revs. Weller and C D Sparshott (Rector)'. </p>
