<p>On September 16th 1939, the 'Reading Mercury' recorded the first military 
casualty of the War, caused by a road accident:</p>
<font size="3"><b>
<p align="center">Soldier Killed by ‘Bus</p>
<p align="center">Black-Out Tragedy at Arborfield</p>
<p align="center">Unsuccessful Effort to Save his Life</p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>A black-out tragedy at Arborfield on Saturday night, in which two soldiers 
were pinned under the front axle of a Thames Valley ‘bus, was described at an 
inquest at Aldershot on Tuesday on <b>Gunner Oswald Hughes</b> (33), who 
received a fractured base of the skull. The other soldier, <b>Gunner John 
Kavanagh</b> (36), was also taken to hospital, where Hughes was placed in an 
iron lung after artificial respiration had been applied without avail.</p>
<p>The Aldershot coroner (Mr. H. M. Foster) conducted the inquest without a 
jury, and the Thames Valley Traction Co. was represented by Mr. John Brain.<a href="../images/new/Ducks_Nest_Farm.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Duck's Nest Farm, on the Eversley Road south of Arborfield Cross" vspace="5" align="left" src="../images/new/Ducks_Nest_Farm_TN.jpg" width="298" height="215"></a></p>
<p><b>J</b><b>oseph House</b>, of <b>Duck’s Nest Farm</b>, Arborfield, said that at 
10:30 p.m. on Saturday [September 9<sup>th</sup>], while standing at his bedroom 
window, he heard some men singing in the road and saw a car swing out to avoid 
them. A ‘bus travelling in the same direction then stopped suddenly, and on 
going outside he saw two soldiers under it. He put the speed of the ‘bus at 
10-12 m.p.h.</p>
<p>The driver of the ‘bus, <b>Douglas Victor Hadley</b>, of 85, Addison Road, 
Reading, said he had been driving for 26 years. He had been employed by the 
Thames Valley Co. since 1925. On Saturday he was driving the <b>single-deck 
relief ‘bus from Reading to Wokingham</b>, via Arborfield. The ‘bus was full of 
soldiers, and as they were singing, he would not have heard outside noises very 
much. His lights were dimmed in accordance with regulations. He could not see 
very well and had to drive by the white line. It was a dark night and there were 
trees along the road. A car came towards him with its sidelights unscreened, and 
after drawing in to the left to let it pass, he went back on to the white line.</p>
<p>"Just after this", he said, "I saw some forms in front of the ‘bus, right on 
top of me, and although I applied the brakes immediately, the ‘bus struck the 
men as it was pulling up. They must have been nearly in the centre of the road. 
I did not hear them before I saw them". Replying to the coroner, Hadley said the 
speed of the ‘bus was eight to ten miles an hour.</p>The coroner recorded a verdict of "Accidental death".<p><a href="../images/new/b9a.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Tilling-Stevens single-decker now preserved at Amberley Chalk-Pits Museum" vspace  =5 align=left src="../images/new/b9a_TN.jpg" width=317 height=228 ></a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[<b><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The bus could well have been an old Tilling-Stevens B9A from 1927, and due for 
disposal in 1939 until the war intervened. By October 1939, there were 12 still in service on relief duties at 
Reading. Many relief buses were put on to the late Saturday evening services.</span></b></p>

Sussex, and is seen here in the mid-1990’s while still under restoration</span></b>]</p>
