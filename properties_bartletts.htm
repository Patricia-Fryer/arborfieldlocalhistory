        <p class="stbody">Bartlett's Farm has not changed that much since it was 
        sold by the Swallowfield Park Estate in 1913, as can be appreciated from 
        the footpath on the hill ridge south of Arborfield Court. This walk is 
        recommended!</p>

        <p class="stbody">The farmhouse is thought to be 16th century and 
        extended in the 18th century, brick with an old tile gabled roof. In the 
        “Reading Mercury” of December 1964 it was described as combining 
        antiquity with interior grace; and the brick cellar suggests Tudor 
        origin.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" src="images/Bartletts_Farm.jpg" width="545" height="394"></p>

        <p class="stbody"><br>
        According to the 1839 Tithe Map, the land at Bartletts was owned by <b>Sir 
        Henry Russell </b>and occupied by <b>Stephen Mills Esq</b>. The extent of Bartletts 
        at this time can be seen on the Tithe Map. However, before 1835 it was 
        owned by <b>John Simonds</b>, as shown in correspondence held at the 
        Berkshire Record Office.</p>

        <p class="stbody">We know from Swallowfield Park Estate Records that in 
        1884 Bartletts Farm had an acreage of 207.133. In 1913 the Arborfield 
        part of the Swallowfield Park Estate was offered for sale by auction by 
        its then owner <b>Sir Charles Russell</b> (grandson of Sir Henry). It was 
        described in general terms as Lot 3 - (coloured RED on Plan) 'a 
        particularly attractive Residential and Sporting Property - comprising 
        195 Acres 2 Roods 5 Poles' and it was offered as 'Bartletts &amp; Ducks Nest 
        Farms'. Most of the land and the Homesteads are described as 'in hand' 
        although two tenants are named for some of the land; <b>A. Broadway</b> and 
        <b>Russell Deane</b>. The 'Fine Jacobean Staircase' is noted in the sale 
        documents within the 'Charming Old House'. </p>

        <p class="stbody"><br>
        From the Agricultural Returns of 1917, it would seem that <b>Lionel and 
        James Kearse</b> were farming at Bartletts. These Returns show the type of 
        crop and the quantity grown and the amount of livestock on the land. At 
        this time the total acreage of crops amounted to 81.5.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Between 1931 and 1939, <b>
        <a href="memories_ravenscroft.htm">Harold Ravenscroft</a></b> farmed at 
        Bartlett's. Click on his name to read some memories of him.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In September 1945, <b>
        <a href="memories_Tilley.htm">Jack Tilley</a></b> took over; it was taken over in 2001 by his son 
        <b>Graham 
        Tilley</b>.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The farmhouse and gardens were bought in 2011 by <b>
        Graeme and Lucy Cooper</b>, who started a thorough restoration of the 
        main building in late Spring.&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Tragic end 
        to Evening's Shooting</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The story of a son's tragic homecoming from holiday 
        was told at the inquest on Thursday evening on <b>Lawrence George 
        Ruffell</b>, aged 58, a farmer, of Bartlett's Farm, Arborfield, who was 
        accidentally shot dead while out alone shooting pigeons on his land on 
        Tuesday night. Tuesday was his birthday.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The inquest was held by the Reading district 
        coroner, Mr. R. S. Payne, with a jury.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The son of the dead man <b>Lawrence Alfred Ruffell</b>, 
        a laboratory assistant at Reading School, said that on Tuesday he 
        returned home from a holiday about 7 p.m., and was told that his father 
        had gone out shooting about a quarter of an hour previously. At 10 p.m., 
        he and his mother became anxious as he had not returned and they 
        searched for him. Between midnight and 1 a.m., he found his father's 
        body in some bracken by a wire fence separating a field from a copse.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">ACCIDENT 
        AT A FENCE</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">It was stated that the unfortunate man walked with 
        a limp on the left leg and from the position of the body and the gun, <b>
        P.C. Keen</b> concluded that he had stumbled in getting over the fence 
        and thrust the butt of the gun on the ground to right himself with the 
        result that the jolt caused both barrels to discharge, shooting him in 
        the head.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Thomas Bennett</b>, a worker at the farm, said 
        he was with his employer gathering peas near the scene of the accident 
        on Tuesday afternoon, when some pigeons flew up. Mr. Ruffell said "I 
        must have some of them tonight, Tom," meaning that he would shoot some 
        pigeons. Pointing to a tree over the wire fence where the body was 
        found, Mr. Ruffell added "That would be a good place to get them." He 
        was in a cheerful mood and remarked that it was his birthday. He said he 
        would not be able to stay long shooting pigeons that night as his son 
        was returning from holiday and he wanted to see him.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dr. J. H. Beatty</b>, of Swallowfield, described 
        the terrible injuries to the head and face.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">A verdict of "Accidental Death" was returned.</p>
