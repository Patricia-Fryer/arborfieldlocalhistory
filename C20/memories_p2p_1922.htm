In the 1910's and 1920's, Army Officers were <b>
<a href="../WW1/WW1_where_are_horses.htm">encouraged to hunt</a></b>, and the 
<b>Remount Depot</b> provided a good race-course for their Point-to-Point 
meetings, as described here.
<p>The 'Reading Mercury' for March 1921 reported the <b>Garth Hunt 
Point-to-Point races</b> at the <b>Remount Depot</b>, attended by <b>HRH Prince 
Henry</b>. </p>
<p>The 1922 races seem to have been organised by the Army rather than by the 
Garth Hunt, as reported on April 1st 1922: </p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">THE ARMY POINT-TO-POINT STEEPLECHASES</font></b></p>
<p>The Army Point-to-Point Steeplechases, which were held at the Remount Depot, 
Arborfield Cross, on Monday, attracted a very large number of spectators, and 
with the entries including some of the best horses in the British Army the 
racing was naturally of a very high order. </p>
<p>By kind permission of Major L. A. Jackson, the function was held in the Garth 
Hunt country on a site which offered ample facilities for the preparation of a 
capital course. Full use was made of the natural features, and the result was a 
well-marked course about four miles in length and including many sporting 
obstacles.</p>
<p>Earl Haig, who was accompanied by Countess Haig, attended the meeting and 
took a keen interest in the proceedings. Earl Haig presented the premier trophy, 
a challenge cup presented by H.R.H. the prince of Wales, to the winner, Captain 
Shaw Stewart, who rode Lieutenant the Hon. R. C. Cubitt’s Limerick.</p>
<p>The onerous duties of hon. secretary were ably discharged by Captain S. G. 
Hawes, D.S.O., M.C., and general the Earl of Cavan, K.P., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., 
K.C.B., A.D.C., was the judge. </p>
<p>Other officials were: Clerk of the course, Major H. O’S. F. Tanner; clerk of 
the scales, Major R. C. Tennant, R.A.V.C.; starter, Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. 
Wilson, D.S.O.; hon. surgeon, Captain E. B. Allnutt, M.C., R.A.M.C.; hon. 
veterinary surgeon, Major W. Ludgate, D.S.O., R.A.V.C.; stewards, Major L. A. 
Jackson, M.F.H., Lieut.-General Sir T. L. N. Morland, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., D.S.O., 
Rear-Admiral R. E. Ross Benson, C.B., R.N., General N. W. Haig, C.B., C.M.G., 
Colonel-Commandant H. C. Jackson C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., Colonel C. E. G. Norton, 
C.B., C.S.L., A.D.C., Lieut.-Colonel A.G.A. Hore-Ruthven, V.C., C.B., C.M.G., 
D.S.O., Wing Commander W. E. Wynn, O.B.E., R.A.F., Major C. L. T. Walwyn, D.S.O., 
O.B.E., M.C.</p>
<p>In the Garth Hunt Race Major F. Anderson’s Glory was freely spoken of as a 
likely winner, whilst Rocket, ridden and owned by Cadet H. C. Walford, who 
achieved a fine run at the Garth Hunt Point-to-Point Races last week, was also 
favoured in some quarters. Neither, however, was successful, although both ran 
well, the ultimate winner being Major H. C. H. Eden’s eight-year-old gelding 
Cyrano. </p>
<p>There was an unfortunate incident in the first race for the Prince of Wales’ 
Cup, when Captain J. C. Rogerson’s Hornbill fell at the difficult double jump, 
known as "The Lane", and broke a leg, its destruction being necessary. In this 
race Captain Shaw Stewart, riding Lieutenant the Hon. R. C. Cubitt’s Limerick, 
was a fortunate winner, as the leader of the field in the final four hundred 
yards refused the last fence. </p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel M. Graham’s gelding, Red Seal, justified expectations in 
securing Earl Haig’s Cup, and in the Past and Present event for the Earl of 
Cavan’s trophy Ballyrafton, ridden and owned by Lieutenant J. A. G. Emmet, took 
the lead early in the race, and, holding it until the end, won comfortably from 
Captain H. A. Pelly’s Spook. Captain W. S. Cornwallis’s Tregeagle, which had 
secured a second at the Garth Races, maintained its form and secured Earl 
Beatty’s Cup.</p>
