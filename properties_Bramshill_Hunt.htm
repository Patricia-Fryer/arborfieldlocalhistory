        The <b>Bramshill Hunt P.H.</b> was on the old Arborfield - Eversley 
        Road, which was quite narrow at this point. There was barely room for 
        two buses to pass outside, and the stops had to be moved to help ease 
        the traffic flow. Even in the 1930's there were <b>
        <a href="properties_bypasses.htm">proposals</a></b> to widen the road 
        here.</p>

        <p class="stbody">When the <b>A.327</b> became the <b>
        <a href="properties_bypasses.htm">Garrison By-pass</a></b> in 1969, the old 
        Eversley Road was severed where it passed through the Garrison. The middle part 
        became <b>'Bramshill Close'</b>, and the southern part became <b>'Sheerlands 
        Road'</b>. North of Langley Common Road is now '<b>Rickman Close</b>'.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The pub had long been associated with the Garrison. It 
        is close to the old Remount Depot, 
        and it is just along from the site of the entrance to <b>
        <a href="aerial/aerial_ref3040_5.htm">Poperinghe Barracks</a></b>. 
        It was by far the closest pub to the now-closed <b>
        <a href="memories_AAS.htm">Army Apprentices' College</a></b>. Poperinghe Barracks is long since demolished, and much of the site is 
        occupied by the <b>Penrose Park</b> development.</p>

        <p class="stbody">This slightly blurred photo shows that the pub was 
        licensed not only for drinking, but also for dancing (If you have a 
        sharper historical image of the pub, please contact the Society!). </p>

        The <b>Bramshill Hunt itself</b> had ceased under its 
        own name as far back as 1850, but most of the 'country' that it used to 
        cover was taken over by the <b><a href="memories_garth.htm">Garth Hunt</a></b>, 
        whose meetings, both in Arborfield and 
        in the wider area, were regularly reported in the 'Reading Mercury'. 
        Both the Garth Hunt and the Farley Hill Beagles started some of their 
        'meets' at the pub.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        This photo is from the 'Reading Mercury' of October 
        10th 1931, showing the <b>Farley Hill Beagles</b> alongside the <b>'Bramshill 
        Hunt'</b> (as announced the previous week under 'Hunting Appointments'). 
        The caption was: <i>'Young and old interested in the pack of the Farley 
        Hill Beagles at the first meet of the season, held at Arborfield on 
        Saturday'</i>. (Photo: 'Reading Mercury'; credited to <b>P. O. Collier</b>). </p>

        Behind the 'Bramshill Hunt' used to be part of the old <b>Wokingham Lane</b>, 
        which has disappeared under the Tarmac of <b>Baird Road</b>. </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Thanks to Alice Allen, we have a photo from the 1910's of a picnic held 
        along Wokingham Lane just behind the pub. Click on it for more detail.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Wokingham Lane used to continue from this point south-east of 
        Arborfield, towards 'Bound Oak' on Castle Hill, Farley Hill. </p>

        The 1841 Census listed the '<b>Bramshill Hunt</b>' as an Inn, with <b>
        Anthony Cole</b> as 'Beerseller'. However, Anthony had been there for 
        some years. When the 1837 Tithe Apportionment Map was drawn up, his 
        dwelling was simply described as a 'cottage and garden', owned by 
        William Cordery. By 1851, Anthony Coles [sic] was only a labourer, while 
        his wife Ann was the beer seller. <b>Charles Clacey</b> was the publican 
        for many years, appearing in the 1861, 1871 and 1881 Census returns, but 
        by 1891 he was a widower living nearby at Langley Common, while <b>
        Richard Whitley</b> was at the inn, combining the occupations of 
        publican and blacksmith. Charles died in 1898, and is buried with his 
        wife Annie at Arborfield.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Kelly's Directories show that <b>Thomas Kelly</b> was landlord in 1895 
        and 1899 (and in the 1901 Census), then <b>William James Rapley</b> in 
        1907 and 1915; William died in December 1926, aged 63. <b>John Henry Allen</b> had taken over 
        by 1929, followed 
        by <b>William Kent</b> , as recorded in the 1935 edition. </p>
