        Although the date of 1661 is found on the chimney of “The Swan”, its 
        history probably dates back to the fifteenth century which is indicated 
        by the architectural features present in parts of the building. These 
        include trees found in the structure, plus their branches; a “priest 
        hole”, which is thought to have been used by local priests at the time 
        of Oliver Cromwell (1649-1660), and a cellar where dead bodies were laid 
        out, as it was thought that this was the coolest room in the village. 
        During its long and varied history the building has also been used as a 
        “whore house”, tea rooms and finally as a public house from around the 
        start of the nineteenth century.<br>
        <br>
        The Swan Inn was an H&amp;G Simonds house, these being the local brewers of 
        Reading. They were closely related to the Simonds family who lived at 
        Newlands and who were local bankers both in Reading and Wokingham. <br>
        <br>
        The earliest record discovered, so far, of the landlords of The Swan, 
        can be found in Snares Directory of 1842, where a <b>
        <a href="C19/families_Richard_Maynard.htm">Mr. Maynard </a></b>is listed 
        as landlord (but in the 1841 Census he was described simply as a 'cordwinder' 
        though with three people lodging with him and his wife). We also know from records that 
        <b>Elizabeth Pitcher </b>was the 
        licensee in 1853 when the rent was Eight Guineas per annum (£8.40p). In 
        2003 it was £36,000.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The <b><a href="C19/families_Pub_landlords_1815.htm">
        Quarter Sessions of 5th September 1815</a></b> identify a <b>John Hall</b> 
        as a 'Victualler' of Hurst, and on the same day they list him as a 'Victualler' 
        of Arborfield. Could this have been at the 'Swan', which was in the 
        Liberty of Newland?&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="stbody">This detail of a postcard from a gentler age shows 
        'Sunrise' and the Swan, with people walking in the middle of what was 
        then known as 'Arborfield Street'. Note the hedges in front of 'Sunrise' 
        and lack of pavements.<br>

        Even in the early 1950's when the Frith's postcard shown below was published, the 
        car was not yet king and there was no continuous pavement on the Post 
        Office side of the road, but by the 1960's, plans were drawn-up for a 
        <b><a href="properties_bypasses.htm">by-pass to the west of the village</a></b>. </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        (An electricity sub-station was erected behind 2 Chamberlain Gardens 
        with cable extending behind Melrose Gardens in readiness for a new 
        estate to be bounded by this by-pass, but both have since been removed).</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        When Simonds merged with Courage and Barclay in 1962, the ‘pub’ became a 
        Courage house and the hop-leaf sign was replaced by the cockerel. Even in the mid-1970's the beer 
        (then still produced in Reading) was taken direct from the 
        barrels, but after this, hand-pumps were installed. Since this time the 
        owners have been Ansells, Inntrepreneur and then Nomura 
        Bank, trading as the Unique Pub Company. </p>
		<p class="stbody">
        Enterprise Inns closed the pub 
		in early 2015 - to be converted into a pub-restaurant - finally bringing 
		to an end a long association with live rock music. The restaurant didn't 
		last very long, and the 'Swan' reverted to a pub. As of 2019, the 
		building was converted to a residence.</p>
