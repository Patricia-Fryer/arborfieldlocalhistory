This is the seventh article for Arborfield in the Berkshire <b>Local History Recording Scheme</b>, 
reference A6-7:<p align="center"><b><font size="4">'The Bullock Family'</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">AN OLD ARBORFIELD FAMILY</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In paying another visit recently to the 
old ruined church of St. Bartholomew at Arborfield, not far from Reading – it 
becomes more ruinous every day, I fear – I recalled that in 1222 the Dean of 
Sarum called attention to the neglected condition of its predecessor. But that 
predecessor was of wood and there was some excuse for its state, for the priest, 
like Keats’ holy bedesman, was old, infirm and blind. I recalled also that the 
lord of the manor of Arborfield at this time was a certain Richard Bullock, and, 
if I mistake not, the family have persisted in the neighbourhood to this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In a pedigree in the Visitation of 
Berkshire of 1532, the family are traced back for five generations to Richard 
Bullock, but an earlier member appears to have been Osmund, who was patron of 
the church towards the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> century. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A Robert Bullock founded a chantry in 
the parish church of Newbury in the 14<sup>th</sup> century for the souls of his 
father and mother and “all the faithful departed”, and it was probably his son 
who was Lord of Arborfield and Sheriff of Berkshire and Oxfordshire in 1384 and 
1391. He died in 1405, and also possessed property in Goring, South Stoke and 
Streatley.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The manor of Arborfield continued in the 
hands of the family until 1589, when it was sold to Edmund Standen. As I stood 
in the roofless nave I remembered that by his will of 1557 a Thomas Bullock left 
ornaments and vestments to Arborfield Church and desired to be buried in the 
chancel next to the tomb of Robert. Tomb, ornaments and vestments have long 
vanished. Thomas also made provision for his wife to “have the upper parlour in 
the manor house at Arborfield”, but if she did not like Arborfield, she was to 
have the farm at Barkham. The manor house presumably stood on the site of the 
present Arborfield Hall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many members of the Bullock family must 
lie beneath the nave and chancel of this old ruined church – an impressive 
thought to be introspective. But the thrush still builds its nest in the 
ivy-covered walls, and in the spring pipes its orisons over the graves of Robert 
and his kin.</span></p>
