        <br>
        As told by Miss A. M. Edwards</font><br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>This article appeared in the 1973 edition of 'Your 
        Village'. The comments in round brackets date from 1973, not the 21st 
        Century!</i></p>

        <p class="stbody"><a href="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1973.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The cover of 'Your Village' in 1973" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1973_TN.jpg" width="135" height="187"></a>A number of Arborfield residents have enjoyed hearing 
        a first-hand account – given with characteristic humour and enthusiasm – 
        of life in Arborfield sixty years ago by Miss Edwards, a former resident 
        of the village, an ex-secretary of the P.C.C. and now a retired 
        headmistress.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">The following is an attempt to portray some aspects of 
        life here at that time for the benefit of a wider public. It is seen 
        through the eyes of a schoolgirl and recorded for posterity by a current 
        resident....<br>
        <br>
        Arborfield was then a very small and compact village centred round the 
        cross with only a few houses in Lower Arborfield, none in Church Lane, 
        and only Cross Lanes Farm on the main road between Greensward Lane and 
        the Cross.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">Miss Edwards lived in one of the two cottages opposite the 
        Grange gates, then known as the <b>Grange Cottages</b> and now as <b>
        Bridge Farm Cottages</b>, as her father was successively coachman, groom 
        and chauffeur to the Rickman family who then occupied the Grange.<br>
        <br>
        This part of the village was always badly drained and <b>Church Lane</b> was 
        frequently flooded in winter, as was the main road to Shinfield. On one 
        great occasion, there was even skating on the meadows beyond the bridge. 
        The main road, like Walden Avenue used to be, had large pot holes making 
        huge puddles in winter and in summer causing clouds of dust. Apart from 
        a few steam engines, traffic was largely horse-drawn carts, wagons, 
        wagonettes, broughams, etc., and it was the practice to scatter a load 
        of straw on the road outside the house of anyone who was ill, to quieten 
        the traffic noise! However, by present-day standards, life was 
        relatively peaceful!<br>
        <br>
        There was, of course, no bus service to Reading and one either had to 
        walk or go by carrier’s cart,<a href="images/Collier/Collier_1846.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Possible a Carrier's Cart passing the Swan - from the Collier Collection" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Collier/Collier_1846_detail.jpg" width="321" height="238"></a> 
        room permitting. Alternatively the carriers – <b>Fullbrook</b> of 
        Arborfield (who lived at the Pheasantries), <b>Maybanks</b> of 
        Finchampstead or <b>Baylis</b> of Barkham – would do one’s shopping 
        instead. Day-to-day needs were catered for by <b>Mr. Seymour</b> the 
        grocer, on the site of the present stores, by Miles the butcher from <b>
        Shinfield</b>, and by a baker’s cart. <b>Mr. Mattingley</b> presided at 
        the Post Office and the <b>Garratt brothers</b> ran a thriving building 
        and decorating business behind the present bus shelter [removed in 2004 
        when the roundabout was completed]. The village also supported a 
        blacksmith – next to the Post Office – a wheelwright bearing the 
        well-known name of <b>Bentley</b> (Mr. Guy Bentley’s father) and even a 
        tailor by the name of <b>Tayler</b>. In sickness the villagers were 
        attended by <b>Dr. Walker from Swallowfield Grange</b> travelling on 
        horseback or by pony and trap.<br>
        <br>
        The<b> “Bull”</b> was kept by the <b>two Miss Radburns</b>, who later 
        retired to the thatched almshouses in Greensward Lane which have 
        recently been pulled down.<br>
        <br>
        The Garrison was then known as the <b>Remount Depot</b> where mules from 
        Ireland and horses were broken in and trained, and from which they would 
        occasionally stray!<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/M_Shearn/Reading_Rooms_Hainworth.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Reading Rooms in Church Lane, from a Collier postcard" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/M_Shearn/Reading_Rooms_Hainworth_TN.jpg" width=293 height=189 ></a>This was before the days of the village hall, and meetings were held in 
        the <b>Reading Room</b> in Church Lane. These included Sunday School, 
        Mother’s Union and “Mothers’ Meetings” (a forerunner of the present 
        Wives’ Group?) at which rolls of material provided by the ladies of the 
        village were sold cheaply and made into garments whilst one of the 
        ladies read aloud.<br>
        <br>
        Life in the village centred very much round the <b>Grange</b> and the 
        Hall. <b>Arborfield Hall</b> stood in a prominent position in the park 
        close to the river on the site where a new house has recently been 
        erected for the Director of the N.I.R.D. The Hall has only been 
        demolished in the last twenty years. At this time it was the home of a
        <b>Mrs. Hargreaves</b>, said to be a descendant of the <b>James 
        Hargreaves who invented the “Spinning Jenny” in 1764</b>. 
        <a href="images/Hall_Sale_1919_pic1.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Arborfield Hall, from the 1919 Auction Sales catalogue" vspace   =5 align=right src="images/Thumb/Hall_Sale_1919_pic1.jpg" width=288 height=210 ></a></p>

        <p class="stbody">This lady is 
        said to have been a somewhat formidable character who travelled about by 
        pony-chaise and occupied a privileged seat in the chancel of the church. 
        She provided a summer fete for the children of Arborfield and Newland 
        who would assemble at the Lodge gates and march down the park behind a 
        band.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">They would be met by Mrs. Hargreaves seated at the entrance of the 
        Hall in her bonnet and attended by her maid, and they would sing “The 
        Minstrel Boy”, “The Ash Grove” and “Land of Hope and Glory”.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">After this 
        performance they would line up, curtsey, and be rewarded for their 
        efforts with a handful of gingerbread biscuits. 
        <a href="images/Hall_Sale_1919_pic2a.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Rose Garden at Arborfield Hall, from the 1919 Auction Sales catalogue" vspace   =5 align=right src="images/Thumb/Hall_Sale_1919_pic2a.jpg" width=288 height=209 ></a></p>

        <p class="stbody">After this, they were 
        free to roam around the grounds, to enjoy the swing-boats specially 
        imported from Reading, or to take part in races, before it was time for 
        tea, which was laid out on long tables. This would be followed by more 
        games and races, after which prizes and gifts would be presented on the 
        terrace.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">About seven o’clock, parents were allowed in to wander around 
        the grounds. At that time, Arborfield boasted a cricket team which 
        played its matches in the park.<br>
        <br>
        At the Grange, <b>Captain and Mrs. Stuart Rickman</b> took a great 
        interest in the children and in all the people of the village where they 
        were greatly respected. Their nephew, <b>Philip Rickman</b>, is now a 
        famous bird artist. They provided a Christmas treat for the children 
        every year when a sumptuous tea was prepared in the Grange kitchens. 
        This was followed by an entertainment consisting of either 
        <a href="images/M_Shearn/Grange_2.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Arborfield Grange, home to Captain and Mrs. Rickman in the 1910's" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/M_Shearn/Grange_2_TN.jpg" width=275 height=177 ></a>a Punch and 
        Judy Show or a conjuror and ventriloquist from Reading.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">The girls were 
        given new scarlet cloaks made in the Grange and the boys grey jerseys. 
         
        </p>

        <p class="stbody">The Rickmans were great supporters of the church and each Christmas gave 
        everyone in the village a present which ranged from a brace of pheasants 
        to an iced cake or a tin according to their “station”.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">The Grange was 
        also the scene of “marvellous” private parties, with marquees on the 
        lawn, cans of cream and once a bagpipe band brought specially from 
        Scotland.<br>
        <br>
        The school at that time had newly moved from the small premises in 
        Greensward Lane – now two<a href="images/M_Shearn/Old_School_1.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Old School in Greensward Lane - now 2 dwellings" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/M_Shearn/Old_School_1_TN.jpg" width="223" height="148"></a> houses – to the present site in School Road. 
        The school building comprised four rooms, one divided by a curtain, and 
        heated with open fireplaces. One room was set aside as a play room which 
        the children could use before school or when it was wet at playtime. 
        They also had swings in the<a href="images/M_Shearn/School.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The new school in School Road, before it was extended" vspace    =5 align=left src="images/M_Shearn/School_TN.jpg" width=287 height=188 ></a> playground. </p>

        <p class="stbody"> <b>“Jimmy” Hayward</b>, the 
        headmaster, allowed the children to bring potatoes to bake in the ashes 
        of the open fireplaces and in the winter allowed them to slide on the 
        frozen pond.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">Perhaps the winters were colder then, as it happened quite 
        often. It presented a colourful picture, with the girls in their scarlet 
        cloaks, and it says something for their standards of behaviour in that 
        supervision was considered unnecessary.<br>
        <a href="images/Old_Post_Office_n_Forge.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Children at the Forge - in their dinner hour, or in their Sunday best?" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/M_Shearn/Forge_2_detail_TN.jpg" width="300" height="210"></a><br>
        In their dinner hour, the children would catch minnows and tadpoles in 
        the pond at the bottom of the road, scramble across the fields to fill 
        their <a href="images/Collier/Collier_A516.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="A schoolgirl from a Collier postcard of the school" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Collier/Collier_A516_detail1.jpg" width=168 height=219 ></a>satchels with chestnuts in <b>“Chestnut Park”</b>, or watch horses 
        being shod at the smithy.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">On the other hand, the girls in their black 
        stockings and button-up boots were expected to curtsey to everyone “from 
        the rector upwards”!<br>
        <br>
        The church featured largely in their lives at that time, and a thriving 
        and competent choir even attracted people from Reading. A retinue of 
        servants from the “big houses”, with the maids in black bonnets and long 
        black skirts would sit in special pews and after the service the 
        children would often go for a walk through <b>“Parfitt’s Farm”</b> (now 
        Bridge Farm) and round <b>Pound Cops</b>e.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">The annual choir outing was a 
        major event. During the First World War they were limited to places like Streatley, but afterwards it was a day at the sea at Southsea or 
        Ramsgate. This called for a 5.a.m. start from the Cross in Mr. Bowyer’s 
        farm wagon from Newlands Farm, which took them to Wokingham Station and 
        brought them home again at about midnight. Choir Practice was first held 
        in the home of <b>“Teacher Frances”</b> (now Mrs. Edwards who, at 92, is 
        one of the oldest inhabitants, and still [in 1973] active in the village) and 
        later in the school.<br>
        <br>
        Other meetings – the Monday “Band of Hope”, and the “Sewers’ Band” were 
        held at the Rectory. The children would be escorted there by <b>“Aunty 
        Kate”</b> – Mrs. Kate Emblen, the mother of our well-known Harry Emblen 
        who now lives in South Africa but still closely follows the affairs of 
        the village. She was a great church worker and would regularly walk with 
        the children from Swallowfield Road to the Rectory and back carrying a 
        lantern with a candle in it to light the way.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">At the “Sewers’ Band” the 
        girls would make various items for a sale of work at Reading Town Hall. 
        During the war they would also join a Saturday working party at the 
        Grange making roll bandages from yards of unbleached calico whilst the 
        ladies made hospital shirts.<br>
        <br>
        They would also display their handiwork at the Arborfield and Newland 
        Flower Show, held in a marquee at Newlands. A standard work in their 
        repertoire was a <b>Nainsook pinafore</b> with wide lace across the chest and 
        over the shoulders. Another feature of the flower show was a prize for 
        the best kept garden. <br>
        <br>
        Other local excitements included the <b>Annual Blackwater Fair</b>, when 
        herds of cattle were driven through the village from Reading Station. 
        Tramps seeking hot water for tea, and pedlars, were quite common. The 
        latter included a weekly Friday visit of a barrel organ and monkey from 
        Silver Street in Reading. These were carried on a donkey cart and the 
        children would love to turn the handle of the organ.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">Another regular was 
        the collector of ‘jam jars and bottles’, for which windmills were given. 
        <a href="images/Bridge%20Cottages%201913.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Bridge Cottages as they were in 1913" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Thumb/Bridge%20Cottages%201913.jpg" width="308" height="212"></a></p>

        <p class="stbody">Another local character was <b>“Blind John of Arborfield”</b> who lived 
        in the centre one of three very poor cottages by the bridge – later 
        converted and modernised to become ‘Bridge House’.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">John could find his 
        way to Arborfield with no difficulty (traffic was rather less of a 
        problem then) where the charitable residents gave him money which he 
        kept in a calico bag.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">He was a great whistler, and when he was not 
        whistling, he was said to be swearing! When he died the villagers 
        subscribed for a stone in the churchyard on which his whistling is 
        recorded.<br>
        &nbsp;</p>

        <p class="stbody">Yes, life in Arborfield has certainly changed since those days; but I 
        wonder if ALL the changes have been for the better?<br>
&nbsp;</p>
