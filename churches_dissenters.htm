  <p class="stbody">
        Until 2003, we knew almost nothing about a <b>Dissenters' Chapel</b> in 
        Arborfield, because there were very few direct references to it. There 
        was a mention of a 'Methodist Chapel' in the 1839 Tithe Apportionment 
        Map's 'Terrier' (List of properties), and in the 1851 Census the building was listed as 'One Chapel, not 
        used for twelvemonth'. It was probably demolished soon after. </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        It was situated immediately <b>opposite the 'Bull' Public House</b> on 
        the Reading Road, next to one of two cottages.&nbsp; We were alerted to 
        its existence by a request from <b>Alan Allwright</b> of Adelaide in 
        Australia, who was researching his family history. He wondered whether 
        it was still in place, or whether there were any photographs of it. It's 
        not, and there aren't. It would reduce the A327 to one lane, and would 
        not be popular with motorists.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Alan had already traced a hand-written document from <b>Rev. William 
        Breach</b>, dated 1813. He was the minister at the time, and continued 
        for many years. He published several pamphlets, some of which survive at
        <b>Reading Local Studies Library</b>. </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Alan also provided a snippet of news from 1746:</p>

      
  <font size="2">
  <p class="stbody"><b><i>... In news just to hand we can report that at yesterdays meeting at 
  John Allwright's new DISSENTERS CHAPEL at ARBORFIELD CROSS, opposite the well 
  respected and appointed BULL INN, a fracas occurred due to a dissent among the 
  Worshippers there and the building was torn down ! </i></b></p>
  <p class="stbody"><b><i>The pulpit was thrown into the village pond ! there is no report of 
  the preacher. Our correspondent is advised that meetings will now be held in 
  the Barn on the Allwright farm at Langley Pond. ......... 2nd APRIL, 1746. </i>
  </b></p>
  </font>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The chapel was quickly rebuilt and remained for another century. It was 
        owned in the 1830's by <b>John Allright</b>, along with the two cottages 
        and a strip of land to the north. By the late 19th Century, the cottages 
        had been rebuilt and formed part of the <b>Newlands Estate</b> - see the 
        1947 Sale Document for their condition when sold at auction.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <b>William Breach'</b>s hand-written letter amounted to around 20 pages with 
        additional notes in the margins.&nbsp; It is a not all readable, though 
        Alan has managed to transcribe 90% or so, and has deposited the 
        transcribed document with the Local Studies Library. Much of it deals 
        with doctrine, but it also traces the main leaders. Strangely, the All(w)right name is barely mentioned. It started:</p>

      
  <font size="2">
  <p class="stbody"><i>"From the present prospect of things among us, I am occasioned to give 
  my best account I can of the preceding state of our Church at Arborfield - 
  Rev. Breach."</i></p>
  <p class="stbody"><i>"Some where near the year 1750 The Church first began …"</i></p>
  <p class="stbody">Here's our interpretation of the chronology based on William 
  Breach's letter and additional notes:</p>
  <p class="stbody">A <b>Mr Norris</b> was unhappy with Church of England. <b>Susanna Norris</b>, his sister, 
  moved from London to Langley Common to be near her brother. A friend of the 
  family, <b>Mrs May of Langley Common</b>, encouraged meetings at Mr Norris’s house - 
  probably in the early1740’s.</p>
  <p class="stbody"><b>Mr Cudworth</b> <b>or Cudmore</b>&nbsp; [both names were used for the same 
  person]&nbsp; was the preacher from 1746 to 1765, and when the 
  house church over-flowed, a new Chapel was built at Arborfield Cross. Another 
  preacher, <b>Mr Gill</b>, joined the fellowship. However, for some reason he later 
  split the congregation, and his followers went to a Barn at Langley Common.&nbsp; 
  Happily, later they came back together as one fellowship</p>
  <p class="stbody">Mr Cudworth was said to be a ‘follower of Witfield’, but believed in infant 
  baptism. <b>George Whitefield </b>and the <b>Wesleys </b>were the founders of Methodism, 
  though Whitfield later broke away because of doctrinal differences.</p>
  <p class="stbody">Mr Norris took over preaching. He was a carpenter, not an intellectual, but 
  ‘a man of spirit’. He seems to have been included in an early Methodist 
  Circuit, with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Charles Brooker, Riseley</b>
    <li><b>William West, Grazeley</b>
    <li><b>John Johnson, Reading</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="stbody">John was also assisted by <b>Richard Knight</b> and J<b>ohn Hall</b>. William Breach ‘of Sinsom’ [Sindlesham] took over, in 1797.</p>
  <p class="stbody">Officers of Chapel on 8th May 1838 were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Wm Breach, Minister</b>
    <li><b>John Targett, Deacon</b>
    <li><b>John Allright, Overseer</b>. </li>
  </ul>
  </font>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The Chapel maintained a Baptism Register, and we can see the main family 
        surnames involved, along with the numbers of children baptised.&nbsp; In 
        summary, they were:</p>

      
  <font size="2">
  <ul>
    <li>34&nbsp;&nbsp; BREACH 
 
    <li>20&nbsp;&nbsp; BLAKE or BLEAK 
 
    <li>13&nbsp;&nbsp; ALLRIGHT or ALLWRIGHT 
 
    <li>11&nbsp;&nbsp; TARGETT 
 
    <li>10&nbsp;&nbsp; GLASS 
 
    <li>10&nbsp;&nbsp; SLAUGHTER 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; ENGELFIELD (various 
        spellings) 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; WARD 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp; BUTLER 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp; LYFORD 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; SIMONDS 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; CORDERY or CORDREY 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; JOHNSON 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; WILLSON or WILSON 
 
    <li>&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; PITHER </li>
  </ul>
  </font>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Several of these were well-known local surnames. Overall, there were 252 
        Baptismal entries, representing 55 surnames and 100 nuclear families. We 
        can guess that the congregation was around 50 adults for much of the 
        Chapel's life. The Women's Institute's history certainly hints that in 
        the mid-1800's<span lang="EN-GB">, 
<i><b>"there was an empty Church and a flourishing Chapel;&nbsp; but in a very short time 
the Chapel was pulled down, as no-one went to it, and those who did not go to 
Church regularly every Sunday could be counted on two hands.&nbsp; The men went in 
the morning and the women afternoon in the winter, evening in the summer"</b></i>.&nbsp; 
        Sir John Hayes, Bart., had become the Rector of St. Bartholomew's in 1839 
        and lasted 40 years, during which the old&nbsp; church was demolished 
        and replaced by the Victorian building in Church Lane.</span></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The Chapel didn't have authority to conduct marriages or funerals. Its 
        members had to go to the local Parish Church for these services, and 
        were treated harshly. For instance, in 1775, Barkham Church's Burial 
        Register strates:<i><b> 'John Allright from Hurst - one of the people called a 
Methodist, therefore not carried into church'</b></i>. </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <span lang="en-gb">Although the Dissenters' Chapel was used by the 
        Methodist Society for many years, it was always privately owned, by the 
        Allwright family - see the </span><b><a href="families_allwright.htm">
        Allwright Family Page</a> <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">for more 
        details.</span></b></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        There's an intriguing entry in the 1861 Census - <b>George Childs</b> 
        from Swallowfield, who lived at <b>Kenny's Farm</b>, was a '<b>Labourer 
        and Local Methodist Preacher</b>'. Where did he preach? By 1871, he and 
        his wife Jemima had moved back to Swallowfield.</p>
