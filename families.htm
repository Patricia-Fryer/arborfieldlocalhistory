<p class="stbody">Arborfield has been shaped by influential families down the 
centuries. Indeed, in 1900, the main country houses in the parish directly 
employed half of the inhabitants of Arborfield and Newland.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Families from more humble backgrounds have left their mark on 
Arborfield since then, and their surnames live on in the roads of the Penrose 
Park and Badgers Mount estates as well as at Arborfield Cross.&nbsp; The 
following list is in alphabetical order:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b>Allright</b> or <b><a href="families_allwright.htm">

      station</a></strong> at <strong>Arborfield Mill</strong>  in 1933.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b>Anderson</b> surname runs like a thread through the 
first part of the 20th Century, when the <b><a href="C20/families_Anderson.htm">
Rev. Joshua Anderson</a></b> (later Canon Anderson) was Rector of Arborfield He 
took a strong interest in the spiritual welfare of the soldiers serving at the
<b><a href="WW1/WW1_CETS_Hut.htm">Remount Depot</a></b> during the <b>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Arborfield_Church.htm">Great War</a></b>, as can be seen by the 
many articles referring to him in the 'Reading Mercury' and 'Reading Standard'. 
He was instrumental in getting the <b>Village Hall</b> built, even though strictly 
speaking, it wasn't in his 'parish' (at the time, it was in the parish of <b>St. Catherine's, Bearwood</b>!). It's not surprising that Anderson Crescent was named after him.</p>

was held in his honour.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b><a href="C20/families_Bayley.htm">Rev. Bill Bayley</a>

Ditchfield</a></b> was <b><a href="WW1/WW1_Barkham_Church.htm">Rector of Barkham</a></b>, 
but the location of the <b>Remount Depot</b>, his close involvement with the 
Arborfield, Newland and Barkham C.E. School, and his prodigious knowledge of <b>
history</b> and <b>archaeology</b> meant that he was well-known in and around 
Arborfield. He wrote some notes on the <b>
<a href="Ditchfield_Church_Notes/Notes_on_Church_History.htm">old Arborfield 
Church</a></b> which were used for a guided tour of the ruins. He died in 1930.</p>

Loddon from 1855.&nbsp; Now only a memory, the original medieval Hall was first replaced 
by a Victorian mansion by the Conroy family, and in the 1960's the new owners, Reading University, 
demolished it and built a modern house called 'Aberleigh' for the 
Vice-Chancellor. It has been let out to private tenants in recent years. <strong>
Thomas Hargreaves</strong> from Accrington in Lancashire married <strong>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Mrs_Hargreaves.htm">Sarah Jackson</a></strong>, of the 
Washington Jackson family of Philadelphia, in Toxteth in 1855, and Arborfield
