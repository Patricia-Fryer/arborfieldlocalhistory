        <p class="stbody">A local journalist, <b>Anthony Walton</b>,&nbsp; lived 
        in Walden Avenue. He was better known as '<b>Agricola'</b>, writing a series of 
        articles on agricultural matters in the 'Reading Mercury'.&nbsp;  </p>

        <p class="stbody">He came 
        to live in Arborfield with his wife <b>Kathy</b> in 1957, having previously 
        lived close by in Farley Hill. His newspaper articles concerning 
        agriculture in Berkshire give a true insight into that world during the 
        1950’s and 60’s. We can read about the end of meat rationing in June 
        1954, the results of myxomatosis, The Wokingham Show, fears over 
        Britain’s application to join the Common Market expressed in 1962, the 
        successes of local farmers such as <b><a href="C20/families_Record.htm">Mr. Record of Targetts Farm</a></b> in 1961, 
        and much, much more. Thank goodness that Mr. Walton kept his press 
        cuttings and his articles about individual Berkshire farmers.&nbsp; The 
        newspaper marked his retirement as follows:</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><i>Mr. Anthony Walton who joined the Reading Newspaper 
        Company in 1951, decided to take life a little easier last week. He 
        became Agricola with his weekly column “Around the Farm” in the 
        “Mercury” in October, 1953, and has since been responsible for writing 
        about local and national farming affairs. In semi-retirement he will 
        continue to keep an eye on the agricultural scene for the “Mercury”.</i></b></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><i>Born in County Durham, three days before the Boer 
        War finished, his roots paternal and maternal, are in Northumbria. After 
        local schools he went to St. Michael’s College, Leeds. Soon after the 
        First World War he joined Holt’s Bank in Whitehall Place, London, but a 
        few months there, dreaming over ledgers, were enough for him to decide 
        to enter the more lively, though more hazardous, profession of his 
        father - journalism. So he began to learn the craft on the “Fulham 
        Gazette” in 1921, and after 18 months there went to the “Wimbledon Boro’ 
        News,” where he stayed for 10 years. He then went into Fleet Street - 
        where his father was on the “Daily Telegraph”, a brother on the “Daily 
        Mail”, and a sister on “The Tablet.” He worked as a reporter and 
        news-room assistant on the Press Association, and then, for four years, 
        on “The Times.”</i></b></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><i>On the outbreak of the Second World War, he, with 
        other Fleet Street men, joined the BBCs hush-hush monitoring service as 
        a sub-editor, and after a few months at Broadcasting House was evacuated 
        to Evesham in Worcestershire, and then (in 1943) to Caversham Park, 
        where he remained until 1950 when the war-time job came to an end.</i></b></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><i>He became interested in agriculture and country 
        life generally when he was billeted during the latter part of the war at 
        Mr. and Mrs. Jack Maidment’s Hampstead Farm, Binfield Heath. He is a 
        member of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists.</i></b><br>

        <p class="sthead"><font size="4">Some Extracts from Newspaper Articles:</font></p>

        <p class="sthead">31st October 1953: Academic Furrows </p>

        <p class="stbody">Arborfield Farm, the N.I.R.D. place near Reading, was 
        considerably enlivened on Wednesday by the inter-University ploughing 
        match, organised by the Reading University Agricultural Club. It was 
        held last year at Wye, the London University College in Kent, and this 
        time the four universities - Oxford, Cambridge, London, and Reading - 
        had another challenger in Nottingham.</p>

        <p class="stbody">It was fairly heavy going after the rain, and ridges 
        in the wheat stubble meant occasional cross-ploughing, but every 
        competitor (four from each university) managed to plough his half-acre 
        in the appointed two-and-a-half hours. On the whole, they opened well 
        and - a more tricky business - finished neatly. Points were lost by not 
        getting down to the required six inches. Two-furrow ploughs were used.</p>

        <p class="stbody">It was almost dark when the last tractor came away 
        into the headland, and the judges found that Reading (D. P. Fulks, B. J. 
        Bailey, W. Roberts, and I. J. Robertson) had accumulated most points - 
        309 - to win the Harry Ferguson challenge cup.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="sthead">26th June 1954: Good-bye To Rationing </p>

        <p class="stbody">On Friday butchers will be free to slaughter, and on 
        Monday, July 5th, they will be free to sell meat to anyone. Rationing 
        will be over. The Ministry will not hold any collecting centres next 
        week, on the days immediately before de-control, nor will farmers be 
        allowed to sell stock to other people.</p>

        <p class="sthead"><br>
        31st July 1954: Rabbit Disease </p>

        <p class="stbody">Some new facts about myxomatosis - now confirmed on a 
        farm near Farley Hill, Berkshire - are given in the Veterinary Rrecord 
        this week. The writer - Mr. R. M. Lockley, of the Nature Conservancy - 
        records the successful transmission of the disease by means of the 
        European rabbit flea, spilopsyllus cuniculi.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="sthead">14th August 1954: Crops, Not Bullets </p>

        <p class="stbody">Driving along the Arborfield-Eversley road this week, 
        I noticed, opposite West Court, a piece of land which was concerned in 
        the squabble a few years ago. Farmer Chandler had just taken the binder 
        round the 13 acres and stooked some first-class dredge corn, following a 
        fine crop of fodder beans last year. No artificials have been used.</p>

        <p class="stbody">This I remember was the bit of land which Wokingham R. 
        D. C. described as the “least objectionable” proposed for a firing 
        range, yet think of the hundreds of gallons of milk one would have lost 
        had all this fodder been denied the Chandler Guernseys!<br>
        <br>
        <b>16th October 1954: If Only.... </b></p>

        <p class="stbody">The devastating results of myxomatosis are now 
        apparent in many places; they are indeed so impressive that some 
        farmers, in that last quiet hour before going to bed, are trying to 
        visualise what this harvest would have been like had the weather been 
        kinder and had myxomatosis descended on us earlier.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Not many weeks ago a certain field at Bridge Farm, between Shinfield and 
        Arborfield, where about 80 Friesians contentedly graze, was alive with 
        rabbits; now, there is hardly one to be seen. The manager, Mr. J. E. 
        Seggons, tells me that his men have picked up as many as 100 bodies a 
        day.</p>

        <p class="sthead"><br>
        16th October 1954: Rabbit Food </p>

        <p class="stbody">Ask Mr. Seggons if he is glad to see the back of them! 
        “I would like to see them die in another way,” he says, “but I cannot 
        forget, for instance, that they have eaten about two acres of a 25-acre 
        piece of dredge. They seem able to consume as much as one cares to sow.”</p>

        <p class="stbody">Perhaps the most telling argument in favour of the 
        beneficial effects of the disease on our food production is his 
        statement that he intends to put down more winter corn now that the 
        pests have gone. He estimates that he will have 10% more cereals to 
        harvest next year.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="sthead">12th February 1955: Crops </p>

        <p class="stbody">The new guaranteed prices for 1955 wheat will be 30s. 
        a cwt. (3d. extra), for rye 23s. 3d. (3d.), barley 24s. 8d. (2d.), oats 
        23s. 3d. (3d.). Potatoes will be worth another 3s. 4d. a ton (215s. 
        10d.), sugar beet another 2s. (127s. 7d.).</p>

        <p class="stbody">All this, of course, is because the farm workers’ minimum wage recently 
        went up from £6 to £6 7s. Their Union asked for £7, and they are still 
        out for that.</p>

        <p class="sthead"><br>
        4th June 1955: A Man’s Wage </p>

        <p class="stbody">The Agricultural Wages Board’s unanimous decision that 
        the present minimum wage rate of 127s. per week of 47 hours shall apply 
        to all male workers aged 20 and over is reasonable, indeed overdue. Many 
        of our 20-years-old lads on farms have for long done the work of older 
        men, with vigour and enthusiasm.</p>

        <p class="sthead"><br>
        22nd March 1958: Wednesday Show </p>

        <p class="stbody">Wokingham are changing their show day this year. The 
        traditional fourth Saturday in September is becoming increasingly 
        difficult now, so this time the show is being brought forward to 
        Wednesday, September 10th. The show may be without some of the usual 
        Saturday attendance, but hopes to gain on the swings what it might lose 
        on the roundabouts.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The Hon. Peter Samuel, who succeeds Sir Geoffrey Lowles as president, is 
        a banker in the family firm of M. Samuel and Co. and a director of the 
        Shell Transport and Trading Co. A son of the late second Viscount 
        Bearsted, he lives at Farley Hall, Farley Hill.</p>

        <p class="sthead"><br>
        April 26th 1958: The Golden West </p>

        <p class="stbody">Mr. and Mrs. W. Goddard, of Arborfield, and Mr. and 
        Mrs. T. D. Page, of Winkfield Row, will be in a party of farmers and 
        growers setting sail in the Queen Elizabeth on May 8th for a nine-day 
        tour of New York State and Canada. The State of New York has been 
        especially chosen because, in serving the city of New York, it has 
        producer and marketing problems comparable with those of farmers and 
        growers here.</p>

        <p class="sthead"><br>
        October 15th 1960: Helping Hand </p>

        <p class="stbody">The Swallowfield Farming Club not only provides 
        educative opportunities and social outlets for its members, but rises to 
        the occasion with a ready helping hand when a fellow is in need. At the 
        annual meeting at Arborfield on Tuesday we heard that the club had not 
        only given a sum to the R. A. B. I. but had also sent, with practical 
        spontaneity, a substantial cheque to a farmhouse where tragedy had been 
        piled on misfortune.</p>

        <p class="stbody">On Tuesday evening Ewart Dance reported a good year 
        (with the second barbecue last July a “roaring success”), and treasurer 
        John Keen showed that the finances are very much on the right side. The 
        Hon. Peter Samuel, of Farley Hill, was elected president. J. H. Vickery 
        was persuaded to go back into the chair, and John Seggons was not 
        allowed to get out of the secretaryship.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="sthead">November 12th 1960: Unlifted Potatoes </p>

        <p class="stbody">A paper-backed book entirely concerned with the 
        four-letter word, 'spud', reached my desk on Thursday. It is the annual 
        report of the Potato Marketing Board for the past year, and it describes 
        the recent autumn as the most disastrous for half-a-century. The 
        peculiar difficulties of producing and marketing potatoes have rarely 
        been so emphasised as in the last few weeks.</p>

        <p class="stbody">We are not, of course, a great potato-producing area 
        here, but nevertheless, a considerable acreage is grown in the 
        south-east part of Berkshire. All the growers have a similar tale of 
        frustration. Bill Goddard, of White’s Farm, Arborfield, told me 
        yesterday that of his 28 acres of Majestics he has been able to lift 
        little more than two-thirds. Much of those still in the ground will 
        probably have to be written off. Until a few days ago he had been unable 
        to lift any for three weeks. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="sthead">August 19th 1961: Farmers’ Fears </p>

        <p class="stbody">Britain’s application to join the Common Market, now 
        formally acknowledged and presently to be considered, is a momentous 
        development in the history of our agriculture; momentous because, should 
        the eventual negotiations in Brussels result in acceptance, it is 
        certain that a drastic change will come over our food-producing 
        industry.</p>
