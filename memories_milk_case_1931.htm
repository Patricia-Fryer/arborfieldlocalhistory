        <p class="stbody"> <b>Cross Lanes Farm</b> experienced drama on 
        Saturday 18th July 1931 at lunchtime when an aircraft <b>
        <a href="memories_air_crash_1931.htm">crashed in a field</a></b>. 
        Later that year, the farmer was in court to defend his good name. Here 
        is how the&nbsp; '<b>Reading Mercury</b>' reported the case in its 
        August 22nd edition:</p>

        successful Defence</font></span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">At the Reading Police Court on 
        Friday last week <b>Charles Walter Crocker</b>, of <b>Cross Lanes Farm</b>, 
        Arborfield, was summoned for selling milk deficient in milk fat on May 
        28<sup>th</sup>. The case had been adjourned on two previous occasions.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mr. F. J. Ratcliffe</b> appeared 
        for the defendant, who pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mr. G. C. Porter</b>, who 
        prosecuted on behalf of the Corporation, said an assistant inspector 
        visited the defendant’s shop at <b>

     >
        19 Whitley Street, Reading</a></b>, and purchased a pint of milk from 
        the defendant’s servant, <b>Miss D. Rollins</b>. The analysis showed a 
        24 per cent deficiency in milk fat, that was to say instead of 
        containing three per cent at least of such fats, it only contained 2.28 
        per cent.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Fifty Years in the Trade</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Ratcliffe stated that the 
        defendant had been for 50 years in the dairy trade. He did not actually 
        take part in the milking himself, but he employed competent assistants, 
        and every precaution was taken to ensure that the milk supplied to the 
        public was absolutely pure and as it came from the cow. It was a 
        well-known fact that milk constantly had come below the standard fixed 
        by the Board of Agriculture from perfectly natural causes. The milk in 
        this case was not an unusual sample, having regard to the weather they 
        were having at the time. The grass crop was exceptionally heavy, and 
        cows would take grass in preference to hay or cake. That was bound to 
        affect the milk.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Witness stated that it was 
        impossible for milk to have been tampered with.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The Bench had decided that the 
        defence had rebutted the charge, and the case would therefore be 
        dismissed.</span></p>

        What we now call 'full-fat' milk is around 3.5% fat, while 
        'semi-skimmed' is around 1.75%, so perhaps Farmer Crocker's cows were 
        simply anticipating a trend...</p>

        Remnants of the original farm out-buildings are still visible off <b>
        Walden Avenue</b>, which was built on one of the fields in the 1930's 
        (and finally received a tarmac surface in the late 1960's).&nbsp; It is 
        not known when the small dairy in Whitley Street was closed; the parade 
        of shops is still quite prominent at the top of the hill on the road 
        south of Reading.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In the 1800's Cross Lanes Farm was part of the <b>
        Swallowfield Estate</b>, owned by <b>Sir George Russell</b>. The Tithe 
        Accounts identify the tenants as <b>R Wells</b> possibly from the late 
        1880's, and <b>Mr Lucas</b> from around 1907;&nbsp; <b>Charles Crocker</b> 
        didn't appear until 1919, though some years the tenant's names weren't 
        listed.</p>
