This is the ninth article for Arborfield in the Berkshire <b>Local History Recording Scheme</b>, 
reference A6-9, recorded by <b>Mr Burley Ridler</b>, who lived at <b>Woodhaven, 
School Road</b>, until the late 1940's, and by 1953 lived at <b>34, Alpine 
Street, Reading.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> The type-written article had no 
illustrations, but photos and maps have been added to this transcript:</span></b><p align="center"><b><font size="4">'History of the village of 
Arborfield, 1938-1945'</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Throughout <b>1938</b> the unsettled 
state of international affairs was reflected in village life. As early as April 
the Parish Council appealed for A.R.P. volunteers. By the autumn there were 25 
wardens, including the 72 year old Rector, <b>Canon J.A. Anderson</b>, and in September 
they organised an emergency distribution of gas masks from the Village Hall at 
the time of the Munich crisis. Also this winter an anti-gas course was held. In 
October special thanksgiving prayers for the Munich settlement were read in the 
church. In December a discussion on National Service took place at the British 
Legion hut. War preparations apart, normal village activities continued: the 
school children staged an Empire Day pageant, and held their usual summer 
sports; the British Legion held a social and a dug-out supper; the annual 
parochial church council was followed by a social at which a presentation was 
made to <b>Mr T.H. Allen</b>, organist for 25 years, and his successor <b>Mr G. St. Clare 
Collis</b> was welcomed. There was also a summer meeting and sale at Arborfield 
Rectory. <b><a href="../images/Mole1.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Mole Inn, Sindlesham Road" vspace  =5 align=right src="../images/Thumb/Mole1.jpg" width=178 height=113 ></a></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Two activities which failed to survive 
the war were the <b>cricket matches held at “Newlands”</b> and the <b>Bellringers’ supper 
at the Mole Inn</b>. Also up to the outbreak of war the handbell ringers visited 
houses in the village during Christmas week. Two matters discussed by the Parish 
Council and still unsettled in 1953 were the provision of a village playing 
field, and an electricity supply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">
<a href="../images/Nicky_Ford/Post_Office_2.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The old Post Office plus the now-demolished Newlands Estate cottages " vspace="5" align="left" src="../images/Nicky_Ford/Post_Office_2_BW.jpg" width="436" height="256"></a>The death occurred of 
<b>Mr J.H. Mattingley</b>, 
whose family had filled the position of village postmaster for 50 years; his son 
<b>Mr P. Mattingley</b> carried on in the tradition, apart from an interval of 
subsequent war service. The Flower Show was held at <b>Targetts Farm</b>, following the 
closing down of the Remount Depot and its replacement by the Army Technical 
School.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>1939</b> opened with continued 
preparations for a possible emergency. In January wardens who had completed 
their course received badges and certificates. <b>Mr A.J. Bentley </b>became assistant 
head warden, and it was stated that out of 25 wardens, 23 were women. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By the early summer an advance party of 
army men arrived and set up tents in a field to the<a href="../images/new/OS_1930s_South.jpg"><img border="2" hspace="5" alt="O.S. six-inch map of Arborfield Remount Depot in the 1930's" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/new/OS_1930s_South_TN.jpg" width="433" height="459"></a> east of Wokingham Lane on 
Ducks Nest Farm land. Having little to do, they appealed to the cricket club and 
games were arranged; they were also loaned goalposts belonging to the football 
club. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In July the first batch of militia men arrived, 1000 in all, and they were 
accommodated in tents in a field west of Wokingham Lane (Whitehall Farm). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By the 
autumn, huts were ready for the second batch of recruits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Four years later the 
vast R.E.M.E. headquarters was set up on land east of the main Eversley Road, on 
the old Remount Depot land. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the outbreak of war a number of 
Territorials were called up and the Observer Corps manned their post on the hill 
beyond Arborfield Court (O.S. 43, sheet xlvi.i). Many of the observers were 
special constables who had already taken an anti-gas course. There were 16 men 
on the strength, including two regulars, <b>Major H.S. Morris</b> and <b>Mr W.T. Cox</b>. The A.R.P. organisation was centred on Ridgefield (<b>Mr and Mrs Capper</b>) but apart from 
a two hour alert on September 6<sup>th</sup> the winter was quiet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At the October meeting of the British 
Legion it was stated that 16 members had joined the Royal Observer Corps, 2 were 
on active service, and a number of sons and daughters of members had 
volunteered; in addition, the A.R.P. service was largely manned by members of 
the Women’s section. It was also reported that the Women’s section and the 
Church Army were jointly running a canteen at the Legion Hall. Decisions taken 
were to change from monthly to quarterly meetings and to devote profits from 
whist drives to a parcels scheme for serving soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although wardens had compiled a list of 
householders willing to receive children, at the last moment Arborfield was 
declared a non-evacuation area. Evening church services were held at the Village 
Hall because of its central position and better black-out facilities. A party of 
ladies met weekly at Arborfield Court (<b>Mrs Prescott</b>) to make garments for the 
Hospital Supply Depot. At a meeting of the Cricket Club held in November it was 
stated that the treasurer (<b>W. Hayward</b>) was on active service. An entertainment 
committee was formed to organise events to raise funds for men serving with the 
Colours. It was stated that it had not been possible to arrange fixtures for 
1940. Normal village activities included an earlier meeting of the Cricket Club 
when <b>Mr Verrall </b>(schoolmaster) resigned as hon. secretary after 17 years of 
service. <b>Mr Hylton Seymour</b> (The Stores), secretary of the Hospital Contributory 
Scheme for 9 years, resigned, and was succeeded by <b>Mr B. Ridler</b>. The eighth and 
last annual dinner of Arborfield &amp; District British Legion was held at the 
Village Hall in February. The usual school sports and prize-giving were held in 
the summer. At the annual meeting of the Parochial Church Council it was stated 
that the belfry had been repaired and that a new organ was urgently needed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The funeral took place in January of a 
former resident, <b>Mrs Rickman</b>, widow of <b>Capt. Stuart Rickman</b>. Occupiers of the 
Grange from 1889-1914, they long made it a habit of giving a red cloak to each 
schoolgirl, and a pair of boots to each boy, and a pound of tea to the aged each 
year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During the year <b>Mrs Anderson</b>, wife of 
the Rector, died. Usually dressed in black and a firm believer in the principle 
of Victorian benevolent visiting, her practical attitude particularly at home 
was a necessary complement to her husband’s somewhat abstracted manner. The 
<b>Misses Hainworth</b>, the Rector’s sisters-in-law came to live with him after his 
wife’s death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>1940</b>. By now practically all 
village events were devoted to helping the war effort. At a whist drive in 
January organised to aid the gift parcels scheme it was stated that 50 men from 
the district had been sent parcels. A number of soldiers from Arborfield camp 
were prizewinners at this whist drive. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This summer a Home Guard platoon was 
formed under the command of <b>Capt. Speller</b> (The<img border="2" hspace="5" alt="Arborfield Cross in the 1930's from an O.S. 6-inch map - Mr Isaac's field is opposite the School " vspace  =5 align=left src="../images/new/OS_1930s_Cross.jpg" width=324 height=203 > Swan) and drilled in 
<b>Mr Isaacs’ 
field</b> (now the site of the housing estate). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The British Legion announced in the 
autumn that 49 members had now undertaken national service. Owing to travelling 
difficulties, sub-sections were formed at Bearwood, Barkham and Newland. In the 
winter a ‘wool gathering’ and a whist drive resulted in £4 for the Army Comforts 
fund. At the end of the year 3700 cigarettes had been sent to serving members of 
the Legion. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A salvage collection was organised by <b>Mr 
and Mrs Capper (Ridgefield Poultry Farm)</b> who collected 9½ tons of scrap metal 
for the Ministry of Supply; the school children also collected scrap metal, 
paper, cardboard, acorns and medicinal herbs; and wardens 8 sacks of aluminium 
from householders. In November <b>Mr and Mrs Verrall</b> (school house) heard that 
their son, <b>Sapper A. Verrall</b>, missing since June, was a P.O.W. in Germany. He 
returned in May 1945.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Among general social events a touring 
revue visited the Village Hall in February. Cricket was restricted to fixtures 
within cycling distance, including games with the local garrison. In September 
<b>Mr E. Bowyer</b> (Newland Farm) was presented with an armchair, and a book with the 
names of subscribers, on his retirement to his new house ‘Arborcot’ at Hurst. 
Farm manager at Arborfield Hall from 1899-1909, he farmed Newland since 1920. 
His parish offices had included churchwarden and parish councillor. At a meeting 
of the parish council it was stated that they would in future be responsible for 
the upkeep of the old churchyard. It was also announced that it was hoped to 
introduce a village speed limit. <b>Mr Verrall</b> succeeded <b>Mr Bowyer</b> as churchwarden 
and as chairman of the hospital contributory scheme.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During Egg Week, organised by <b>Mrs J.H. 
Simonds</b>, 826 eggs were collected for the Royal Berkshire Hospital. The Women’s 
section of the British Legion held an American tea and garden fete at Newlands 
(<b>Mr &amp; Mrs J.H. Simonds</b>) and £16 was realised for the Soldiers’ Comforts Fund.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mr Guthrie Allsebrook</b> (Arborfield Hall) 
resigned as vice-chairman of the Parochial Church Council on his removal to 
Shinfield. The death took place of <b>Mr J. Thomas</b>, who lodged with <b>Mrs Edwards</b> in 
the village street [at Mileham Cottage], and had reported the meetings of the <b>
<a href="../memories_garth.htm">Garth Hunt</a></b> for the previous 11 years. 
Trimly dressed with a red tie and a buttonhole, his somewhat ingratiating 
manner, curved nose and red face tended to give him a slightly vulpine 
appearance. A keen church worker, he had acted as a sidesman.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>1941</b>. At the January meeting of 
the British Legion, the death was announced of <b>Mr B. Middleton</b>, one of their 
oldest members; in the same month a party from the military camp gave a concert 
at the Village Hall in aid of the branch benevolent fund. At the May meeting of 
the Parochial Church Council it was stated that both finances and church 
attendances had improved. At a meeting at the Village Hall in July a local 
branch of the <b>Domestic Poultry Keepers’ Council</b> [D.P.K.C] was formed with 
<b>Mr A.W. 
Capper</b> as chairman and <b>Mr B. Ridler</b> as secretary. In August a Pony and Dog Show 
was held at Newlands in aid of the Royal Berks. Regt. P.O.W. fund of which <b>Mr J.H. Simonds</b> was president. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At a meeting of the Village Hall 
committee, <b>Mr S.G. Bentley</b>, assistant secretary for 12 years, resigned on his 
call-up, and was succeeded by <b>Mr B. Ridler</b>. The village postmaster, <b>Mr P. Mattingley</b>, was called up and was succeeded for the war by 
<b>Mr A.J. Bentley</b>.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During the winter some of the services 
at the Village Hall were taken by <b>Capt. Benson</b>, a chaplain from the Army Camp. 
In December there was a carol singing at the Village Hall by the combined choirs 
of the Women’s Institute and the church, and a nativity play by the school 
children. (Inspired by <b>Major H.S. Morris</b> and not very enthusiastically received 
by a small audience).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At a meeting of the British Legion it 
was stated that £10 had been realised as proceeds of dances for the P.O.W. 
tobacco fund. <b>Mr A.J. Bentley</b>, secretary of the Legion since 1929, resigned and 
was succeeded by <b>Major H.S. Morris</b>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>1942</b>. In January the writer 
joined the Home Guard, having served in the A.R.P. service since its inception 
and continuing to do so. The <b>Home Guard local commander</b> was now <b>Capt. Godwin</b> of 
Wokingham, <b>Mr J.H. Simonds</b> serving as a sergeant. Among the N.C.O.’s and other 
ranks were a number of civilian instructors from the Army Technical School who 
were a useful stiffening. The H.G. met at the Village Hall (and later at the 
British Legion hut) twice a week, and in the Park behind Arborfield Hall 
riverside lodge, on Sunday mornings. The water filtration plant by the river was 
a defence point, and mine attachments were placed on Arborfield Bridge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Arborfield Hall</b> had been taken over by 
the military, and Nissen huts were erected in the Park (these were occupied by 
squatters after the war). The <b>Grange</b> suffered the same fate, and the occupier 
(<b>Mrs Vickers</b>) lived in her gardener’s cottage (<b>The Old School</b>) in Greensward 
Lane. Officers from Arborfield Garrison were billeted at <b>Arborfield Court</b> and
<b>Newlands</b>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Anti-tank obstacles were erected at the 
Cross opposite the Bull at the top of Swallowfield Road, and in front gardens in 
the village street. A party of airmen were stationed in a Nissen hut east of the 
orchard at <b>Arborfield Hall Farm</b> under conditions of great secrecy and were 
billeted in the village. It was understood after the war that they had operated 
a <b><a href="../properties_hall_decoy.htm">decoy</a></b> landing strip.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Between 1940 and 1942 a number of bombs 
fell in the village: in the garden behind the Bull; in the grounds of Arborfield 
Court (shaking articles off mantelpieces in the village street); and in a ditch 
on the Church edge of Great Newland field (O.S. 183). But there was no real 
damage or casualties. A lone raider caused excitement one Sunday morning by 
machine gunning the camp and the R.O.C. post. From points in School Rd. and the 
Eversley Rd., the patrolling warden could see the glare in the sky of the battle 
of London, while on the hill above the village the R.O.C. maintained their 
ceaseless vigil, having been responsible by the end of the war for the 
destruction of a number of enemy aircraft which they had picked up from one 
sector and passed to another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Events continued to be organised to aid 
the war effort. The Pony and Dog Show at Newlands, dances at the Village Hall, 
efforts by the Legion, which included the supply of £7 worth of cigarettes for 
servicemen; by the school children who collected in 6 months 2 tons of paper, 1 
ton of iron and nearly 10 cwt of other salvage. Later the Women’s Institute 
agreed to undertake the general organisation of salvage collection. A 
house-to-house collection organised by <b>Mrs J.H. Simonds</b> raised £7 for the Air 
Raid Distress fund. 
<img border="1" hspace="5" alt="Allotments 91, 92, 93 and 99; Cricket field 83" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/new/OS_1930s_Cross3.jpg" width="242" height="281"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The pre-war Cottage Garden Show was revived by Mrs Simonds 
and held at the Village Hall. There were 110 entries and first prize for 
cabbages was won by Arborfield School who now had an allotment on a piece of 
land belonging to Newland Farm (O.S. 99) next to the allotments (O.S. 91, 92, 
93). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At a D.P.K.C. meeting it was announced 
that 30 pullets had been bought for members, and a quantity of potatoes and 
kitchen waste [sic].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Arborfield Juniors cricket team was 
formed and played in Chamberlain’s Farm field (O.S. 83).  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Normal social events 
were a jumble sale and a school Chris<a href="../A_N_1947_20a.htm"><img border="1" hspace="5" alt="Woodbine Cottage, off Swallowfield Road, home to Stephen Emblen." vspace  =5 align=left src="../images/new/Applemore%20Cottage.jpg" width=157 height=127 ></a>tmas party.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A happy event was the diamond wedding of
<b>Mr Stephen Emblen</b>, a native of Arborfield, and employed for 50 years 
at Newland Farm under four employers. A holder of the R.A.S.E. long service 
medal, he and his wife lived in a thatched cottage opposite the old 
<b><a href="../A_N_1947_13a.htm">Chamberlain’s farm house</a></b>. (After the war and after the deaths of the two Emblen’s this cottage was modernised). Among his 7 children is 
<b>Mrs Day</b> who lives 
in the village street.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An unhappy event was the death of <b>Mr 
Foster</b> (bailiff to Mr J.H. Simonds) who was found shot; he had been in bad 
health. He had held office as a member of Newland Parish Council.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This year the <b>Evening Institute</b> was 
transferred from Three-Mile-Cross to Arborfield School, and also a flight of the 
Air Training Corps was formed with <b>Mr W.D. Nation</b> of Farley Hill School and 
<b>Mr W.J. Verrall</b> as members of the staff.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>1943</b>. Among the numerous efforts 
for the prosecution of the war were a Red Cross whist drive (£5-3-6), a British 
Legion women’s section social and dance (£15-4-6), Wings for Victory Week 
(£2653). The school children collected 2400 books for salvage; production on the 
school allotment achieved a high level, while the boys also dug the gardens of 
those in the village whose menfolk were serving with the Forces. The Village 
Produce Association reported a successful year’s working, and this year together 
with the Domestic Poultry Keepers Club with whom they had amalgamated they held 
their first show. Committee meetings were held at the Swan, and seeds &amp; 
fertiliser bought for members were stored in an outbuilding at the Bull.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In May a church parade was held to 
commemorate the third anniversary of the Home Guard and as a thanksgiving day 
for the North African victory. Taking part beside the Home Guard were members of 
the British Legion, W.A.A.F.’s and A.T.C.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At a pony, dog, and baby show organised 
by <b>Mrs J.H. Simonds</b> at Newlands in September, the judges included two U.S.A. 
officers. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This winter Mrs Hayward of School Road 
heard that her husband, <b><a href="families_Hayward.htm">Sergt. W. Hayward</a></b>, 
missing for 13 months, was a Prisoner of War in Borneo. Her sister, <b>Mrs Wallace</b>, 
lost her husband in the naval battles following the fall of Crete. Their father, 
<b>Mr Saunders</b>, who lived with Mrs Hayward, was a retired coastguard who had a 
flagpole in his front garden, and ran up the Union Jack on Trafalgar Day and 
other suitable occasions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In December a party was held at the 
Village Hall to welcome home <b>Pte. A. Bush</b> repatriated from a German P.O.W. camp 
after 3½ years’ imprisonment. <b>Mr F. Bayliss</b>, the village carrier (of Barkham 
Hill) was called up, after temporary deferment through the efforts of the parish 
council. He was most unfortunately killed in the last months of the war during 
the advance into Germany. Friendly and helpful, Fred Bayliss was a popular figure 
in the village. His family had acted as carriers for many years, and in the days 
when the waggon and horses preceded the motorcar his team stopped to bait at the 
<b>Magpie and Parrot</b>. This year the Parish Council secured an improvement in the 
‘bus service. This was a thorny question for many years as owing to the buses 
being crowded with troops, villagers often had to walk to the Barkham end of 
School Rd., to the other side of the military camp to be sure of a seat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At a Parochial Church Council meeting in 
the spring the Rector announced that the Conroy chapel in the old church had 
been broken into and most of the panelling stolen. The ancient communion rails 
and certain other woodwork had been removed to the Rectory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At the annual general meeting of the 
Village Hall committee <b>Mr J.H. Simonds</b> resigned as treasurer and was succeeded 
by <b>Mr B. Ridler </b>as secretary/treasurer. Autumn events included a school 
prizegiving and a Women’s Institute entertainment in the Village Hall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>1944</b>. This was a year of 
transition in which a number of wartime activities came to an end including the 
stand-down of the <b>Home Guard</b> and the discontinuance of the V.P.A., although 
these last two bodies held a highly successful show during the year. An appeal 
was launched by the P.C.C. for £1000 for the repair of the organ. Apart from a 
Salute the Soldier week, and efforts for the P.O.W. fund, there was a carnival

with the Victory celebrations in June, the retirement of <b>

retiring Rector had held the living for 48 years, since leaving college. In his 
earlier years he had visited his parishioners in a pony and trap but had 
latterly used a car. A big man crippled by arthritis latterly, which caused him 
to shamble rather painfully. A man of strict principles he threatened to 
withdraw his support from the cricket club if they played games on a Sunday, and 
he once walked out of a village concert because he considered an item indecent. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He was industrious to the last in spite 
of his age, in visiting his people and in welcoming new comers. He was 
particularly helpful to the writer when he was seeking information on the past 
history of the village. In some ways he seemed a rather pathetic survival of a 
more respectful age of cap touching parishioners. The more modern attitude was 
typified by his surreptitious nickname of “Holy Joe”. Obviously disheartened by 
his skeleton church attendances, his sermons were often devoted to admonishing 
his errant parishioners. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">His successor was in complete contrast, 
a man of about 40 who had seen service in Newfoundland and with the fleet, and 
was married with 2 small boys. Completely affable to all and sundry, he soon 
became known as the padre and was commonly addressed as such. When the writer 
first called on him, he opened the door and apologised for not shaking hands as 
he was busy staining the floor. He entered fully into village life but there was 
no great improvement in church attendance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One may summarise the effect of the war 
and the two years of uneasy truce preceding it, as marked by the disappearance 
of a number of old customs, the closing of most of the large houses, thus 
influencing local employment, and the impact of a steadily increasing military 
garrison whose members enlivened the public houses, penetrated into the village 
homes, and inter-married with the local girls.<a href="../aerial/aerial_ref4042.htm"><img border="1" hspace="5" alt="Cross Lanes Farm, Walden Avenue, Reading Road and Ridgefield Poultry Farm from the air, 1946" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/new/walden_ave_aerial.jpg" width="359" height="318"></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The main building development took place 
at the north end of the village, a new road of houses called <b>Walden Avenue</b>

turning) at the bottom of Arborfield Hill, adjoining <b>Cross Lanes Farm</b>, and were 
begun about 1938.</span></p>

and chairman, and during the years 1940-45 nearly £300 was collected. After its 
operation ceased I was chosen by ballot among organisers in the Wokingham area, 
having the honour of attending a garden party at Buckingham Palace. After <b>Mrs 
Anderson’s</b> death, <b>Mrs Verrall</b> undertook most of her work in the parish, and 
became enrolling member of the Mothers’ Union, secretary of the C.M.S. and of 
the Waifs and Strays Society, and collector for the F.W.O. fund. <b>Canon Anderson
