        <p class="stbody">
        This is the site of Poperinghe Barracks, sandwiched between Eversley 
        Road and Wokingham Lane, with the 'Bramshill Hunt' public house at the 
        apex towards the top of the picture. All of the military buildings have now 
        completely disappeared, while the pub has grown in size. The Barracks
        <font style="font-size: 9pt">had been used until just before D-Day in 
        1944 by the Royal Artillery, and</font> became<font style="font-size: 9pt"> 
        the 'Training Battalion and Depot R.E.M.E.' in July 1946. </font>  </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Lining the west 
        side of Eversley Road are some old cottages, now replaced by Whitehall 
        Mews. Further south are other houses that now form part of Sheerlands 
        Road.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        On the other side of Eversley Road are the Council Houses; note the very 
        long back gardens, which were later cut back in order to develop the 
        line of bungalows built in Valon Road in the 1970's. </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <a href="../images/Waste%20Site.JPG">
        <img border="0" src="../images/Thumb/Waste%20Site.JPG" alt="The Piggeries, which were proposed to become a Waste Transfer Station in the 1990's" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="354" height="264"></a>When 
        the Garrison By-Pass was built in 1969, the western-most groups of 
        military huts (known as 'spiders') were severed from the remainder of 
        Poperinghe Barracks, and the land was sold. The buildings became a piggery. Meanwhile, the fields to the 
        north of Wokingham Lane quietly developed into workshops and a 
        scrap-yard, and the owners later had to apply for 'certificates of lawful use' 
        because the premises had been in use unchallenged for over ten years.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        To the east of the Garrison By-Pass, a new service-road known as Baird 
        Road was created, as shown in the aerial photo taken in 1985 (seen 
        below, with the Piggeries in the distance). </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Baird Road was fully equipped with street lights, and was intended to 
        serve the new Married Quarters in Kelvin Close, Faraday Close and 
        Fleming Close, seen in the foreground of this photo. However, Baird Road was severed 
        by two sets of locked gates by the late 1980's (though it was still a public 
        bridleway), and these weren't removed until after the Penrose Park 
        estate was completed.</p>

        <p class="stbody">

        <p class="stbody">
        The land to the east of the By-Pass and Baird Road was cleared of most of 
        its huts, leaving just the guardroom, post office and newsagency on what 
        remained of Eversley Road (now a cul-de-sac named Bramshill Close). 
        Behind these buildings was a modern Community Centre, home to the Thrift 
        Shop and Nursery until the end of the 1990's when a replacement 
        Community Centre was built off Sheerlands Road. This allowed the 
        Ministry of Defence to sell off the entire area for development, and it 
        has 
        now developed into Penrose Park.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        Finally, the Piggeries, temporarily used as light industrial units in 
        the late 1990's, became the 'Poppyfields' estate, served by a road named 'Poperinghe 
        Way'. </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        The only known remains of Poperinghe Barracks is a piece of wooden 
        flooring cut to size and laid at St. Bartholomew's Church by the late 
        Wally Barlow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
