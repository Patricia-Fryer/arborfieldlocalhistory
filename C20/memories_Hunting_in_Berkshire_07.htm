This is from Article 7 of the 30-article <b>‘Hunting in Berkshire’ </b>series by
<b><a href="families_Cope.htm">J. Hautenville Cope</a></b>, which was published 
in the ‘Reading Mercury’ on April 2nd 1921.<p align="center"><b><font size="3">
HUNTING IN BERKSHIRE</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">By J. Hautenville Cope.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">(ARTICLE VII.)</font></b></p>
<p>The <b>Bramshil</b>l country now being vacant, it was now necessary to take 
measures to continue the sport. A meeting of the members of both the <b>
Bramshill Hunt</b> and the <b>South Berks. Hunt</b> – <b>Captain Brown, of 
Bylands</b>, in the chair – was held at the Bear Hotel, Reading, on February 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
1850. After the letter of <b>Mr. Wharton</b> (<b>Sir John Cope’s lawyer</b>) had 
been read, it was resolved:</p>
<p><i>"That the cordial thanks of the meeting should be conveyed to Sir John 
Cope in a letter to be written for that purpose, thanking him for the 
sportsmanlike manner he has hunted the country for a period of thirty-four years 
and for the sport he has been enabled to show during that long period". </i></p>
<p>At the same meeting <b>George Montagu</b> gave warning that at the end of 
that season he would not continue to hunt that part of Sir John Cope’s country 
known as the <b>South Berks</b> country; Mr. Montagu, for the manner in which he 
had hunted the South Berks country since <b>Mr. Thoyts’</b> resignation in 1847, 
was awarded a vote of thanks. </p>
<p>By Montagu’s resignation the South Berks country, as well as the Bramshill 
country, was vacant; the meeting thereupon decided that the two areas should be 
re-united and made one country as it was when Sir John Cope succeeded <b>Mr. St. 
John</b> in 1817. <b>Mr. Wheble</b> stated that as Sir John Cope had resigned, 
and also offered his hounds to any gentleman who would hunt the country, he 
would undertake the mastership provided that a sufficient subscription would be 
raised to guarantee him from loss. <b>Captain Brown</b>, <b>T. C. Garth</b>, <b>
J. Bligh Monek, of Coley Park</b> (the secretary of the South Berks Hunt), and
<b>George Montagu, of Caversham Hill</b>, the retiring Master of the South 
Berks, were appointed as a committee to ascertain how much financial support 
might be expected from gentlemen within the country; they were to report the 
result of their efforts at a meeting which would take place on February 16<sup>th</sup>, 
1850. </p>
<p>Before this meeting could take place, namely, on February 11<sup>th</sup>, 
another letter was received from Mr. Wharton, written by desire of his client, 
Sir John Cope, to say that the letter of January 23<sup>rd</sup> was now 
withdrawn – this was the letter in which Sir John tendered his resignation and 
made the offer of the hounds to any gentleman who would come forward as Master, 
the letter of January 23<sup>rd</sup> having been written on the understanding 
that <i>"Mr. Garth would take the hounds and hunt the country as Sir John has 
and is hunting it".</i></p>
<p>This second letter must have come as a bombshell after the decisions of the 
meeting of February 2<sup>nd</sup>. One of the old Master’s complaints was that 
he had not received the resolution of thanks passed at the meeting of February 2<sup>nd</sup>. 
It appears that those who held this meeting were under the impression that the 
resolution would be conveyed by Mr. Garth to Sir John Cope, who seems to have 
been annoyed at this neglect, and some further letters were received from Mr. 
Wharton to this effect. However, a letter of apology and of explanations was 
sent, which Sir John considered satisfactory. </p>
<p>Thus the matter ended before the next hunt meeting on February 16<sup>th</sup>, 
which, as usual, took place at the Bear Hotel, Reading. The committee appointed 
to find out how much financial support might be expected were able to say that 
their efforts had been very successful. It was therefore agreed that <b>Mr. 
Wheble</b> should be guaranteed £1,000 per year as long as he should hunt the 
country or until he should receive six months’ notice from the hunt that the 
amount could not be continued. Seven gentlemen gave their names as guarantors 
with this proviso: <i>"If the amount required of us shall not exceed one year’s 
subscription in addition and in proportion to our subscription"</i>; the seven 
were <b>Robert Allfrey</b>, who had recently purchased <b>Wokefield Park</b> 
from the <b>Brocas family</b>; <b>G. H. Montagu</b>, <b>
<a href="../families_conroy.htm">Edward Conroy</a></b>, <b>J. Bligh Monck</b>,
<b>T. C. Garth</b>, <b><a href="../families_simonds.htm">John Simonds</a></b> 
and <b>A. Mainwaring</b>.</p>
<p>[… Three hunts from the 1850’s were then described in detail; the first 
around <b>Burghfield</b>; the second around <b>Stratfield Saye</b>, are not 
listed here, but the third from <b>Farley Hill</b> on February 2<sup>nd</sup> 
1852, as recorded in <b>"Bell’s Life"<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">,</span></b> 
is described thus:]</p>
<p>"These hounds had another very fast run, meeting at <b>Farleigh Hill</b>, the 
residence of <b>Mr. Standish</b>. They found in the gorse directly, and went 
away to <b>Moor Copse</b>, <b>Shinfield</b>, crossed the <b>Loddon</b> and 
pointed for <b>Beech Hill</b>; here the pace was so great that only six were 
with them, viz., Messrs. <b>Wheble</b>, <b>Conroy</b>, <b>William Standish</b>,
<b>St. John</b>, <b>Robert Tocock</b>, and <b>David Edwards</b>. There was a 
short check near <b>Spencers Wood Common</b>, when the fox was viewed again and 
raced towards <b>Pinge Wood</b>, but turned through <b>Harley Cour</b>t and ran 
to ground in a drain near the two-mile house; being dug out, he once more faced 
the open and was run into after racing fifty minutes. <b>Mr. William Standish</b> 
met with an accident, after which <b>Mr. Montagu</b> left the field."</p>
