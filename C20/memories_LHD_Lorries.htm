The 'Times and Weekly News' of January 28th 1944 carried an upbeat article on an 
incident that occurred outside the village shop; a baby was uninjured, despite 
her pram being crushed following a collision between two Army lorries:<font size="3"><p align="center">
<b>Army Lorry Crash at Arborfield</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>A Baby and Three Women Involved</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>When two army lorries were involved in a crash at Arborfield Cross on Friday 
last, three local women and a baby in a pram had a narrow escape. The two 
lorries were passing each other on the Reading Road by <b>Chitty’s Store</b>, 
when the covering of one was torn off and thrown over to the grass verge where 
three women were standing, one of them, <b>Mrs. Muir, of Walden Avenue</b>, 
Arborfield, with her baby in its pram. The lorry hood struck all three, and the 
pram was completely smashed, but the baby was uninjured. All the women were 
rendered unconscious and ultimately received medical attention.</p>
<p>A ‘Times and Weekly News’ reporter interviewed <b>Mrs. Sirrett</b>, also of
<b>Walden Avenue</b>, who was standing with <b>Mrs. Muir</b> and <b>Mrs. Henn of 
Council Cottages</b>, when the accident occurred. Mrs. Sirrett, who sustained 
slight facial injuries and a broken collar bone, was completely unaware of the 
impending accident until she was struck by the lorry’s hood. "I don’t remember a 
thing", she said. "I must have been wandering about the road and was taken in by
<b>Mrs. Allison</b> [of <b>Birch House </b>- see below], who gave me a cup of 
tea. It was then that I realised that I couldn’t use my arm, and later, when the 
doctor was called, he told me I had broken my collar bone".</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Muir</b>, who sustained shock and slight concussion, received medical 
attention from an army ambulance unit, which was passing at the time. </p>
<p><b>Mrs. Henn</b>, who also received cuts and was suffering concussion, was 
taken to hospital.</p>

  <p>Sadly, events took a turn for the worse during the week, and on February 
  4th the newspaper announced:</p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>Army Lorry Crash at Arborfield: Woman Dies </b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p><b>Mrs. Muir</b>, who with her thirteen months old baby, was involved in an 
accident caused by two army lorries on January 21<sup>st</sup>, has died in 
Reading Hospital, presumably as a result of injuries sustained. </p>
<p>Mrs. Muir, who was 22 years of age, was treated for shock and slight 
concussion by an army ambulance unit. On the following day, however, she was 
sent to the <b>Royal Berks Hospital</b>, and she died on Tuesday.</p>
       
  <p class="sthead">

        <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
 
  <p>The following week's newspaper reported: </p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>Inquest on Mrs. Muir of Arborfield – Open Verdict Returned</p></b></font><font size="2">
<p><b>Mr. J. L. Martin</b>, the Coroner for Reading, conducted an inquest on 
Friday on <b>Mrs. M. F. Muir</b> of Walden Avenue Arborfield who died in the 
Royal Berks Hospital on February 1<sup>st</sup> following injuries sustained 
during an accident at Arborfleld on 21<sup>st</sup> January.</p>
<p>Evidence of identification was given by <b>Mr. Muir</b> who said that his 
wife was 22 years of age and her health was good. He last saw her after the 
accident when she was brought home. She was admitted to the Royal Berks Hospital 
on 27<sup>th</sup> January. Asked whether his wife remembered anything of the 
accident, Mr. Muir stated that she had remembered being on the footpath with her 
baby, and talking to two other women, but she did not remember being struck by 
anything.</p>
<p>Deceased did not show any signs of injury but complained of an acute headache 
and stiffness in the back. <b>Dr. H. B. Jacobs</b>, House Surgeon at the Royal 
Berks Hospital, stated that deceased died on February 1<sup>st</sup>. There were 
no signs of external injuries. He attributed cause of death to Haemorrhage which 
he presumed was caused by a heavy blow. It might, he further stated, have been 
caused as a result of a heavy fall. She was conscious when admitted to the 
hospital and remained in that condition until she died.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. M. A. A. Sirrett</b>, of Walden Avenue, Arborfield, who was also 
involved in the accident, stated that she was talking to Mrs. Muir and another 
woman. Mrs. Muir was definitely standing on the footway on the Reading Road. She 
did not remember seeing any traffic. "I was bending over the pram to speak to 
the baby" continued Mrs. Sirrett "and the next thing I remembered was that I was 
in a neighbour’s house. I sustained a broken collar bone".</p>
<p><b>Cpl. E. A. Brown, R.E.M.E.</b> stated that about 3.15 p.m., on January 21<sup>st</sup> 
he was driving an Army truck on the Reading Road, Arborfield. He thought he saw 
women standing in the road in front. One was holding a bicycle which was 
completely in the road. "I pulled up to go round them when I saw another vehicle 
approaching. I thought there was sufficient room to pass, but the wooden side of 
my vehicle’s body was ripped off. There was an injured woman on the roadside and 
I went to her assistance". Witness further stated that his speed was 25 m.p.h., 
and his truck was a left hand drive. </p>
<p>The driver of the other vehicle involved, <b>Pte. Stockhill</b>, stated that 
he was driving a G.M.C. Lorry and he first saw the oncoming lorry when it was 70 
yards away. He saw the women half in the road and half on the footpath. <b>He 
further stated that he was driving a left hand drive lorry for the first time</b>.</p>
<p>The Coroner returned an open verdict.</p>

  <p>In the run-up to D-Day in June 1944, Army lorry drivers were being trained 
  in the use of American left-hand drive vehicles. It is difficult to judge how 
  much clearance is needed when the driver is sitting on the near-side of the 
  vehicle. Unfortunately, the stretch of the Eversley Road near Birch House is 
  at its narrowest. </p>
       
  <p>The combination </font>of two left-hand-drive 
      lorries meeting on such a narrow stretch of Eversley Road, with one of the 
      drivers being inexperienced in their operation, caused the lorries to 
      glance against each other, ripping the roof from the northbound 
      vehicle.&nbsp;A villager paid the price for driver training on the local 
      roads. </p>
