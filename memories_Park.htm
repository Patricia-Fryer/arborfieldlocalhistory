          </b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">This year the Parish 
      Council has acquired 10 acres of land in order to fulfil a long, long felt 
      need. From the minute books, we recall the following:</font>          
                      
           </p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">As long ago as 
      <strong>1938</strong> the purchase of a recreation ground – a site behind 
      <strong><a href="pictures_collier_B916.htm">"Pond Cottages"</a></strong>, 
      120 yards x 200 yards, was considered, which could be financed by the 
      selling of 2½% Consols worth £150. However, the land was in the Liberty of 
      Newland and consultations were made with the <strong><a 
      href="newlandcouncil.htm">Newland Parish Council</a></strong>. This 
      Council felt that the project was financially extravagant which could not 
      be supported due partly to being unable to afford a full-time groundsman! 
      So the matter was left for more settled times. 21 years later in 1959, the 
      amalgamated Councils decided it was time to have another go, when the 
      project occupied an abnormal amount of time and no less than nine sites 
      were examined. The final choice of site was the same as 1939. However, the 
      owners objected, and to a second site off the <strong>Swallowfield 
      Road</strong>. The Council was not prepared to proceed further and 
      <strong><a href="Memories_Herbert_Lee.htm">Mr. H. Lee</a></strong> allowed 
      villagers to use a field for soccer and cricket.</font>          
                     
                    
                    
                    
                  
                    
                     
                    
                     
                     
                    
                    
                </p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">In 1961, a village meeting approved 
      the expenditure of £200 to the new <strong><a href="C20/memories_APFA.htm">Arborfield Playing 
      Fields Association</a>   
      </strong>, which was formed after a meeting called by the 
      <strong>British Legion</strong>. The money was 
      spent on levelling the site adjacent to the Legion Hall. After this 
      operation little use was made of the area until 1965 when the Association 
      requested a further grant to purchase children’s equipment; this was duly 
      sanctioned at a parish meeting and £400 was used to provide the various 
      pieces of equipment.</font>         
                   
                     
                   
                    
                  
                     
           </p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">In 1967 the Association 
      was again in jeopardy and the Council formed a new committee with the 
      Legion, to continue to run the play area. In 1971 the lease renewal became 
      due, but the Legion required the area on which to build a new hall, thus 
      it became necessary for the Council to consider a more permanent solution. 
      A temporary agreement was reached that the equipment could stay on the 
      Legion site until it was required by the builders of the hall.</font>          
                     
                     
                       
                   
                     
              </p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">At a parish meeting in 
      1970 the Council was authorised to investigate sites and open negotiations 
      for the purchase of the land. One year later a meeting supported the 
      choice of the site behind the Bull Inn. Since then, the parish council, 
      through the Berkshire County Council, have been engaged in a local 
      enquiry. The owners and the tenant farmer withdrew objections in early 
      1973 and negotiations for valuations etc. are under way.</font>          
                    
                     
                   
                     
                  
           </p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">On 24<sup>th</sup> September, the Parish Council took over 10 
      acres of land and it is hoped it will be opened in part in early 1974. 
      Several village organisations have already given donations for trees 
      for<strong> ‘Plant a Tree Year 1973’</strong> . These 
      donations will be used to purchase trees for the recreation ground. This 
      will be an area for everyone, to give pleasure to young and old alike for 
      the villagers of Arborfield in perpetuity.</font>
