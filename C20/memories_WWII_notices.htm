<p>The wartime local newspapers didn't start their news until page 2; the front 
page was reserved mostly for announcements of births, marriages and deaths, 
local entertainments, and official notices.</p>

<font size="2">
<p>On May 19th 1939, the 'Times and Weekly News' announced: </p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>Public Notice: National Service – Berkshire</b> </p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>REQUIRED AT ONCE: Territorial Army, 4<sup>th</sup> Battalion Royal Berkshire 
Regiment; R.A.O.C., (all types of skilled craftsmen); Women’s Auxiliary 
Territorial Service, […], County Police: <b>Special Constables:</b> <b>
Arborfield</b>, Bearwood, […], Woodley &amp; Earley, Wokingham. ENROL NOW.</p>

  <p>On December 27th 1941, war was declared on a new enemy: </p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>Announcement</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Berkshire War Agricultural Executive Committee</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Grey Squirrels</b> </p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>Under many conditions Grey Squirrels may be a serious menace to Agriculture, 
and, as there is cumulative evidence that they are largely on the increase in 
the county, the County War Agricultural Committee desire to impress upon all 
occupiers of property on which Grey Squirrels exist, the need for their 
destruction. An advisory pamphlet as to the best way of doing this may be had on 
application to the Executive Officer of the County War Agricultural Committee at 
1, Abbot’s Walk, Reading. </p>
<p>While the County War Agricultural Committee will be loath to do so, they will 
not hesitate, in appropriate cases, to use their powers and serve a Statutory 
Order requiring those having the right to destroy grey squirrels to do so. 
Failure to carry out such an Order is an offence against the Defence (General) 
Regulations, 1939.</p>

  <p>More threats of official action lurked in the following announcement on 
  November 21st 1942:</p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>Announcement</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Berkshire War Agricultural Executive Committee</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Unthatched Ricks</p></b></font><font size="2">
<p>Having regard to the very large number of unthatched ricks throughout the 
County, the Committee think it well to draw the attention of farmers to the 
terms of General Defence Regulation 62(a), which provides that: -</p>
<p>"If the crop harvested from any agricultural land is damaged or goes to waste 
as the result of any failure or delay in the occupier of the land in taking such 
steps as are reasonable to keep the crop in good condition, the occupier shall 
be guilty of an offence against this regulation and shall, on summary 
conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding £50."</p>
<p>The Committee would urge all farmers who have not already done so, to take 
all necessary steps to act at once to prevent deterioration of valuable crops by 
thatching all ricks, and if any individual case the Committee is not satisfied 
that such steps as were reasonably possible have not been taken, they will not 
hesitate to submit the facts to the Minister of Agriculture with a request that 
proceedings may be initiated. </p>
<p>The Committee are fully conscious of the difficulties under which many 
farmers are today labouring owing to labour shortage, and they are prepared to 
consider applications for assistance from the Committee’s gang labour.</p>

  <p>The warning was repeated on September 9th 1944:</p>

<p align="center"><b>Announcement</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Berkshire War Agricultural Executive Committee</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Thatching</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>The attention of farmers is drawn to the urgent need to get all corn ricks 
thatched as soon as possible [the announcement promised that the committee would 
take action against farmers who didn’t comply in good time].</p>

<p><b>Mr. Goddard</b> of Arborfield complied with this notice, but as the 'Times 
and Weekly News' reported on October 13th 1944:</p>

<p>In conformity with the policy of the Ministry of War Transport, commencing on 
Sunday, 3<sup>rd</sup> January, 1943, no services will be run on Sunday mornings 
except for the conveyance of workers engaged upon work of National Importance. </p>
<p>To enable the Company to make the necessary arrangements for any such special 
workers' services, factory managements are requested to send full particulars of 
their requirements. Applications for any such special facilities can only be 
entertained when made through the managements of firms and not by individuals.</p>
