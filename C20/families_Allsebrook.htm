<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Guthrie Allsebrook 
      </strong>ran a specialist water-supply company for many years from the Artesian Works 
      in Crown Street in Reading (just to the south of London Street). He was 
      born into a farming family in Wollaton, Nottinghamshire.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">By the 1881 census when Guthrie 
      was 6, his father <strong>William Pole Jones Allsebrook</strong>, 
      originally from Foxall in Staffordshire,&nbsp;farmed 297 acres and 
      employed 10 men and 5 boys.&nbsp;His mother&nbsp;<strong>Sophia Perry 
      Allsebrook</strong>, originally from Chorlton-on-Medlock in Lancashire,&nbsp;had 
      6 children living at home:&nbsp;<strong>Fanny</strong>, aged 
      13, born in Little Bromwich in Warwickshire; <strong>Robert</strong>, aged 
      12, born in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire; <strong>Alan Pole</strong>, aged 
      10, from Wollaton; <strong>Guthrie</strong>, aged 6; 
      <strong>George</strong>, aged 3; and <strong>Eric</strong>, aged 2. Living 
      with them were a cowman, a carter, a ploughboy, a labourer, a cook and a 
      housemaid. His father eventually took on the roles of land agent and 
      valuer, and died in 1906&nbsp;in his mid-70s.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">Guthrie and his wife<strong> 
      Leonora Weldon (nee Lloyd)</strong> married in Croydon in about 1902; they 
      bought <strong><a href="../properties_hall.htm">Arborfield 
      Hall</a></strong> in 1926, with <strong>Hall Farm</strong> going 
      to&nbsp;<strong><a href="../properties_hall_footpath.htm">Herbert 
      Holdstock</a></strong>.&nbsp;By the 1930s the Allsebrooks were fully 
      involved in village life, being founder members of the <strong><a 
      href="properties_VH.htm">Village Hall Management Committee in 
      1932</a></strong>       
        . Members of the family put on a 
      <strong><a href="#Pantomime">pantomime&nbsp;at the Village Hall in January 
      1933</a></strong>. That year, a major project was completed to pump water 
      from a 340-ft well below <strong>Arborfield Mill</strong> and store it in 
      reservoirs at the top of a hill off <strong>Highland Avenue, 
      Bearwood</strong>. The project, carried out for Wokingham R.D.C., 
      culminated in an <strong><a href="councils_water_supply_1933.htm">opening 
      ceremony at&nbsp;the pumping station on 19th July 
      1933</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Lindsay Anne 
      Allsebrook</strong> was married at Arborfield Church in February 1939, as 
      described <strong><a 
      href="memories_WWII_weddings.htm">here</a></strong> 
               
              .</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">In October 1939,&nbsp;the 'Reading 
      Mercury' featured the work of Guthrie Allsebrook and Co. in an article 
      entitled <strong><a href="memories_DPK.htm">'How to increase crops - Rain 
      when it's needed'</a></strong> 
               
              .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Arborfield Hall</strong> was taken over for military 
      use during WWII, and the Allsebrook family moved to 
      <strong>Shinfield</strong>      
                 
       .&nbsp;The water-pumping business continued to prosper under Guthrie and 
      his son Colin; Guthrie died on 30th December 1965, aged 91&nbsp;at The 
      Grove, Shinfield. His&nbsp;funeral was held at Arborfield Church January 
      4th 1966, and his <strong><a href="#Obituary">Obituary</a></strong> 
      appeared&nbsp;with identical wording in both the Reading Mercury of 
      January 8th and the Reading Chronicle of January 7th.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">The business continues into the 
      21st Century but under the&nbsp;name<strong><a 
      href="http://www.allsebrookservices.co.uk/"> 'Allsebrook Pump and 
      Electrical Services Ltd.'</a></strong>, operating from <strong>Stoke 
      Row</strong> near <strong>Henley-on-Thames</strong>.&nbsp;The old company 
      records have been deposited at the <strong>Museum of English Rural Life in 
      Reading</strong>, and include a&nbsp;catalogue of 
      pumps and pumping machinery&nbsp;dating from January 1912. Among its 92 
      pages are details of "artesian borings, tube wells, dug wells, water 
      towers, reservoirs, tanks, mains, water wheels, hydraulic rams, wind 
      engines filters, power units, boilers and sewage

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>Pantomime at 
      Arborfield.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">A pantomime, “Puss in Boots”, 
      written and produced by <strong>Mrs. Guthrie Allsebrook</strong>, was 
      presented at <strong>Arborfield Village hall</strong> on Friday and 
      Saturday, January 6th and 7th. The old story of the cat who brought good 
      fortune to his master was retold with considerable skill, and modern 
      songs, dances, and references to local events cleverly introduced.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">The title role was played by 
      <strong>F. W. Gascoigne</strong>, who was excellent in the part of Sam, 
      the cat. <strong>Miss Anne Allsebrook</strong>, as Tim, his master, sang 
      and danced charmingly, while others who appeared were <strong>J. C. P. 
      Allsebrook</strong> as Hans, <strong>H. Warner</strong> as the King, 
      <strong>Miss B. Wells</strong> as the Princess, <strong>Miss F. 
      Jervoise</strong> as Mrs. Flinders, <strong>G. Allsebrook</strong> as 
      Gehu,<strong> V. Robinson</strong> as Dandy, <strong>Miss R. 
      Prescott</strong>, the witch; members of the chorus: <strong>Mrs. 
      Robinson</strong>, the <strong>Misses Prescott, Vincent and 
      Richards</strong>, nursery rhyme children, the <strong>Misses G. Carter, 
      Hart, Ravenscroft, Walmesley and J. Carter</strong>. <strong>Miss M. 
      Gibbons</strong> sang two old-English songs and the danseuse was 
      <strong>Miss M. Walmsley</strong>.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">The Arborfield Guides and Brownies 
      appeared as fairies, boggarts, guards, etc. <strong>Miss Gladys Lindars' 
      orchestra</strong> accompanied the pantomime and played selections in the 
      intervals. The electric light plant was lent by <strong>Messrs. Stuart 
      Turner, of Henley-on-Thames</strong>, and the electric fittings and 
      effects by <strong>Messrs. Herbert, of Reading</strong>. The scenery was 
      by <strong>Mr. Colin Allsebrook</strong>.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">At the conclusion of Saturday 
      night's performance Mrs. Allsebrook, in response to calls for the 
      producer, came on stage and thanked all those who had helped to make the 
      production a success. The proceeds were in aid of the Village hall 
      Fund.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      name=Obituary></a>Obituary</strong> of <strong>Guthrie Allsebrook</strong>, 
      from the 'Reading Mercury', 7th January 1966:</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody" align="center"><font 
      size=2><strong>DEATH OF MR. GUTHRIE ALLSEBROOK</strong></font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">A man who was extremely 
      well known and very popular throughout Reading and in the South of 
      England, Mr. Guthrie Allsebrook, died at his home, The Grove, Shinfield, 
      on Thursday last week. He was 91.</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">Born near Nottingham, he 
      spent his first 21 years on his father's farm, and during this time 
      developed a great love and understanding of country things. He completed a 
      five-year apprenticeship with a Nottingham firm making engines, pumps and 
      machinery for laundries and sugar-refineries.</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">In 1901, after travelling 
      around the world installing machinery for various firms, he bought the 
      old-established water-supply business of Edward Margrett at Reading, which 
      then became “Margrett and Allsebrook”. The business was later renamed 
      “Guthrie Allsebrook and Co.”, the name of the present firm. It is 
      interesting to note that Mr. Allsebrook's death coincides with the 
      centenary year of the original business – started in 1865.</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">His long association with 
      the water-supply business made him one of the foremost authorities on the 
      subject in the South of England, and together with his son, Mr. Colin 
      Allsebrook, he was the first to draw attention to the potential supplies 
      of water in the Kennet Valley. Their suggestions began the plans for the 
      Kennet Valley Water Scheme.</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">Mr. Allsebrook started up 
      in business after an argument with his boss because he had worked too 
      hard!</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">He was at the time 
      working for a London engineering firm as assistant manager. The manager 
      fell ill and Mr. Allsebrook worked like a trojan during his absence. The 
      manager on his return accused Mr. Allsebrook of trying to steal his job 
      and sacked him. With a loan from his father, Mr. Allsebrook bought a small 
      well-boring firm, which has become the present-day firm of “Guthrie 
      Allsebrook and Co.”</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">Mr. Allsebrook was one of 
      the first to join Reading Rotary Club and remained a member for 45 years. 
      A mason, he was a member of the Kendrick Masonic Lodge.</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">The funeral service was 
      held at Arborfield Church on Tuesday.</font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2"><em><br>An identical obituary, but headlined <strong>“MR. 
      GUTHRIE ALLSEBROOK HAS DIED AT 91”</strong>, was published in the “Reading 
      Chronicle” for 7th January 1966.</em>
