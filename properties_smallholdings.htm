        <p class="stbody">After the Great War in 1919, the Government proposed 
        an agricultural scheme to rent smallholdings to returning soldiers, with 
        the land to be owned by the County Councils.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In the Wokingham Rural District Council area, three 
        local schemes were planned, plus a <b>training centre</b> to be built in 
        Barkham. The lands at <b>Barkham</b> are still owned by the successor of 
        Berkshire County Council (Wokingham District Council), though several of 
        the cottages were sold at auction around 1980. Over the border to the 
        west, there was a scheme at <b>Great Lea House Farm in Shinfield</b>, while in 
        <b>Newland</b>, part of <b>Carter's Hill Farm</b> was offered. </p>

        <p class="stbody">There was a Special Meeting of the B. C. C. Small 
        Holdings and Allotments Committee held at the Shire Hall, Reading, on 
        Saturday, 20 September, 1919 at 11.30, which moved the schemes forward. 
        Under the heading 'ARBORFIELD' (though it was in Newland Parish), was 
        the following: </p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><i>Part of Carter’s Hill Farm. Mr J. M. Dimond who 
        recently purchased Carters Hill Farm, Arborfield, has offered to the 
        Council 20 acres of pasture land, and two semi-detached Cottages, part 
        of this farm, for the sum of £1,150. The Sub-Committee are favourably 
        impressed with the offer and consider it will form 2 useful Cottage 
        Holdings and its acquisition is therefore strongly recommended.&nbsp; 
        Approved and adopted.</i><br>
        </b>
        <br>
        A later meeting on Saturday, 17 January, 1920 got the parish right:<br>
        <br>
        <b>
        <i>NEWLAND – Part Carters Hill Farm. A revised draft scheme dealing with 
        this property has been under consideration. It provides for an 
        expenditure of £…. Initial repairs, £640 on two small sets of farm 
        buildings, and £60 on fences. Although this property (comprising about 
        20 acres) was purchased at a reasonable price with two excellent modern 
        cottages on it, a loss is estimated at about ….</i><br>
        </b>
        <br>
        The 'Reading Mercury'&nbsp; of 13th November 1920 reported on all three 
        schemes: </p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><i>B.C.C. Small Holdings Committee. Newland: Carter’s 
        Hill Farm. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have approved the 
        proposed work of adaptation to be carried out at Carter’s Hill Farm at a 
        cost of £870. The revised estimate of £870 is recommended by the Finance 
        Committee for approval. Great Lea House Farm, Shinfield. A draft scheme 
        to divide into 7 holdings. Barkham, Brook Farm – cost of materials 
        recorded at £11,819.10s, in excess of original estimates. </i></b></p>

        <p class="stbody">The Local History Society would like to research this 
        scheme in more detail. The holding is almost certainly <b>Betty Grove</b>. Some 
        of the 
        farm buildings are still standing. It is not clear which cottages were 
        sold, but it seems to have been the more modern pair that still exist. 
        The pair of cottages known as 'Betty Grove' have been demolished. Two cottages, each with a land holding, were let to 
        ex-servicemen in the early 1920’s. </p>

        <p class="stbody"> <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">We believe that</span> Bert Lock</b> took over the 
        cottage now known as <b>Birds Nest</b> in the early thirties, together 
        with the land in Winnersh parish. The tenant in the other cottage (<b>Catkins</b>) 
        was evicted in the late thirties for poor husbandry and Bert Lock took 
        over all the land. He farmed until the mid sixties when ill-health 
        forced him to give up. He and his wife were re-housed at Bayley Court in 
        Winnersh.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" alt="'Catkins' is on the left, and 'Birds Nest' on the right" src  ="images/C_H_1919/Cottages_at_Betty_Groves.jpg" width=605 height=427 ></p>

        <p class="stbody">The old <b>Thames Valley Traction Company</b> sold off their 
        old wooden double-decker bus bodies to owners of small holdings in the 
        1920's, and four ended up in the area - we think that they must have 
        been used as hen-houses at Carter's Hill.<br>
        <br>
        The small holdings at Carter's Hill were sold at auction by the County 
        Council on 29 September 1969. Cottages (with vacant possession) and land 
        in the parish of Winnersh were sold to Hatch Farm Dairies, Mill Lane, 
        Sindlesham. Land in the former parish of Newland was sold to <b>Mrs. J. 
        Bryant</b>. This was later owned by the former Parish Council Clerk, the 
        late <b>Liz Ayers</b>, who maintained stables there. Part of the land in 
        Winnersh must have remained with the County Council, because in the 
        1970's the Council created '<b>Sindlesham School</b>' as a residential 
        centre. The head teacher, <b>Mr. Francis</b>, and his family used to 
        attend Arborfield Church, and at least one Parochial Church Council 
        meeting was held at their house '<b>Star Goose</b>'.<br>
