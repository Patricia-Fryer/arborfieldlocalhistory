The 'Reading Mercury' on 3rd June 1922 reported extensively on the opening of 
the Orphanage at Bearwood as follows:<p align="center"><b><font size="4">ROYAL 
MERCHANT SEAMEN’S ORPHANAGE</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">OPENING BY THE MARQUIS OF GRAHAM </font>
</b></p>
<p>Ninety-five years ago five boys, the orphans of merchant seamen, were placed 
in the charge of a Mr. and Mrs. Fisher in a private house in St. 
George’s–in-the-East. This proved to be the modest commencement of an 
institution which during a century of strenuous life has cared for 2,725 
children from all parts of the world, and which at the present time is guarding 
the interests of 328 girls and boys in one of the most b<a href="../images/Bearwood/College/South%20Front%20with%20Tower.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The south front, Bearwood Mansion" vspace   =5 align=right src="../images/Bearwood/College/South%20Front%20with%20Tower_BW_TN.jpg" width=276 height=207 ></a>eautiful estates in 
Berkshire. Such an institution is the <b>Royal Merchant Seamen’s Orphanage, Bear 
Wood, Wokingham</b>, and Saturday was a landmark in its history, for then Commodore 
the Marquis of Graham, C.B., C.V.O., formally opened these magnificent premises, 
acting on behalf of H.R.H. the Duke of York, K.G., who was unable to be present.</p>
<p>The broad features of the orphanage remain the same to this day as were 
decided upon at a public meeting held on October 25<sup>th</sup>, 1827, but 
during these 95 years it has passed through many vicissitudes. In 1829, when 11 
boys were being provided for, the management decided to enlarge their scope, and 
five girls were admitted, but illness of the children and constant expense for 
"changes of air" then occupied the minds of the management, and in 1834 both 
boys and girls were installed in an old mansion in Bow Road, where the work 
continued for 28 years. At the close of that period, 106 children were in 
residence. In 1862 another forward step was taken, when the orphanage at 
Snaresbrook was opened by Lord John Russell, the foundation-stone having been 
laid in the previous year by the late Prince Consort. </p>
<p>During the 60 years of life at Snaresbrook, the great work was carried on in 
an unostentatious manner, and year by year improvements were made, mainly by 
generosity of such philanthropists as Lady Morrison and Mr. John Harrison Allan, 
of Leadenhall Street, and the enterprise and sustained enthusiasm of the 
management. Gradually increased brightness and comfort was brought into the 
children’s lives, and everything possible was done to remove the stigma which 
undoubtedly attached to what used to be contemptuously termed a ‘charity 
school’. Intelligent interest in current affairs of the great outside world was 
cultivated; cricket, football and sports generally were fostered, and pleasant, 
though profitable, occupation was found for the children during their spare 
time. Above all, the children were encouraged to take a pride in themselves, and 
to feel that, with honesty, industry and legitimate ambition, there was nothing 
to prevent them from rising high in the world. </p>
<p>Much invaluable work was done whilst the orphanage was located at 
Snaresbrook, but a circumstance which gave grave anxiety to the managing body 
arose in later years, when faulty brickwork necessitated reconstruction at a 
cost estimated at £4<a href="../images/Bearwood/College/House%20Main%20Gates.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Bearwood Mansion from the main gates" vspace   =5 align=right src="../images/Bearwood/College/House%20Main%20Gates_TN.jpg" width=180 height=134 ></a>5,000. They were undismayed, however, and the chairman of 
the board (Sir Thomas L. Devitt, Bart.) did not rest until, with the 
co-operation of Sir Alfred Yarrow, Bart., he purchased the mansion of Bear Wood, 
with its appurtenances and 500 acres of land, and presented it to the 
institution in November 1919, as his magnificent gift comprised the mansion 
itself, built at a cost of £250,000 by the third Mr. John Walter, of "The 
Times", <a href="../images/Bearwood/College/Jellicoe%20House.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Jellicoe House, whcih was converted to an infirmary" vspace="5" align="left" src="../images/Bearwood/College/Jellicoe%20House_TN.jpg" width="180" height="134"></a>beautifully laid out grounds, a large garden with orchard, artisan’s 
workshops, home farm and modern stabling, which has since been converted into a 
school hospital. </p>
<p>Great expense was naturally entailed in altering the buildings to make them 
suitable, and notwithstanding the generosity of friends of the late Mr. F. W. 
Marten, of Lloyd’s – who contributed £10,465 10s. towards the erection of the 
"F. W. Marten Memorial Dining Hall" – and of the King George’s Fund for Sailors 
and the Baltic and Lloyds’ Ambulance Unit, the sum of £30,000 is still required 
to relieve the institution of the incubus of debt still outstanding.</p>
<p>It is a brilliant record that out of nearly 4,000 orphans who have found a 
home and preparation for the world within its walls, hardly any have failed in 
life. During the war upwards of 700 were commanding and officering merchant 
vessels that helped to save the country from famine or worse, whilst some thirty 
held commissions in the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>Brilliant weather favoured the ceremony on Saturday, and a large and 
representative company assembled at the orphanage to greet the Marquis of 
Graham, who was received at the entrance hall by the deputy-chairman (Mr. R. J. 
Lesslie), the secretary (Mr. F. W. Rawlinson), and governor (Captain W. J. 
Jenks, R.N.R). </p>
<p>The children were lined up on either side of the main drive,<a href="../images/Bearwood/College/Main%20Drive.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The impressive main drive from Bearwood Road" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/Bearwood/College/Main%20Drive_TN.jpg" width="180" height="134"></a> and 
after the arrival of the Marquis they marched past, headed by the school band, 
each section under its own officers. From the miniature drum-major to the 
smallest boy and girl the children looked happy, healthy and smart. </p>
<p>After the 
march-past the company immediately assembled in the new dining hall, where the 
Marquis of Graham was supported by Mr. R. J. Lesslie, Sir Alfred Yarrow, Mr. F. 
W. Rawlinson, Mr. A. L. Sturge (chairman of Lloyd’s), Captain W. J. Jenks and 
Colonel Leslie Wilson, M.P. </p>
<p>Amongst those present were: <br><br>Sir Alan and Lady Anderson, <br>Sir Kenneth and Lady 
Anderson, <br>Sir W. S. and Lady Abell, <br>Sir S. and Lady Abram, <br>Sir H. Acton Blake, 
<br>Captain Sir de M. and Lady Baysham, <br>Mr. and Mrs. Walter Burness, <br>the Mayor of 
Wokingham, <br>the Mayor of Reading, <br>the Rev. W. H. and Mrs. Bayley, <br>Mr. C. F. 
Brightman, <br>the Right Hon. A. and Mrs. Carlisle, <br>Dr. and Mrs. Curl, <br>Captain Sir 
A. W. and Lady Clarke, <br>Miss Devitt, <br>Mr. Howson F. and Mrs. Devitt, <br>Mrs. and Miss 
A. Devitt, <br>Mr. P. H. and Mrs. Devitt, <br>Miss Florence and Miss M. G. Devitt, <br>Miss 
Deacon (head mistress), <br>Mr. and Mrs. Erlebach, <br>Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Eustace, 
<br>Mr. W. G. and Mrs. Glover, <br>Mr. I. C. and Mrs. Geddes, <br>Captain H. H. Hooper, 
<br>Lieut.-Colonel N. O. and Mrs. Lane, <br>the Rev. R. E. Langdon (chaplain and head 
master), <br>the Rev. B. and Mrs. Long, <br>the Rev. N. A. and Mrs Lash, <br>Mr. H. J. Arbon, 
<br>the Hon. K. and Mrs. Mackay, <br>Colonel and Mrs. Mackenzie, <br>Mr. G. A. Messenger, 
<br>Mr. Walter Morris, <br>Mr. Charles and Mrs. Mansfield, <br>Alderman Sir W. R. and Lady 
Pryke, <br>Lieut.-Colonel and Mrs. Poulton, <br>Miss Ritchie (matron), <br>Major M. H. and 
Mrs. Simonds, <br>Mr. T. W. and Mrs. Stephens, <br>Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Scott, <br>Mr. and 
Mrs. J. Herbert Scrutton, <br>Miss Ruth Scrutton, <br>Sir W. H. and Lady Turner, <br>Mr. E. 
A. and Mrs. Veale, <br>Colonel and Lady Victoria Villiers, <br>Mr. and Mrs. John Walter, 
<br>the Rev. H. M. and Mrs. Walter, <br>Mr. Stephen Walter, <br>Sir E. Shadforth Watts and 
Lady Watts, <br>Mrs. Leslie Wilson, <br>Sir J. H. and Lady Wimble, and <br>Mr. and Mrs. John 
Weir.</p>
<p>Mr. Lesslie regretted that their chairman (Sir Thomas Lane Devitt) was unable 
to be present, and stated that a letter had also been received from the 
Treasurer (the Right Hon. Lord Inchcape, of Strathnaver) regretting his 
inability to be present. Proceeding, Mr. Lesslie gave details of the events 
which led to the acquisition of the Bear Wood Estate, and paid handsome tribute 
to the generosity of Sir Thomas Devitt and Sir Alfred Yarrow. He gave details of 
the work and careers of past children of the institution, and remarked that at 
the close of their education about two-thirds of the boys expressed a desire to 
go to sea.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">ROYAL INTEREST</font></b></p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson then read the following letters, which had been received from 
the King and Queen Alexandra:-</p>
<p align="right"><i>Buckingham Palace.</i> </p>
<p><i>I am commanded to convey to the Board of management of the Royal Merchant 
Seamen’s Orphanage the expression of the King’s thanks for their kind message to 
his Majesty.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>On the occasion of the opening of the institution’s new home at Bear Wood 
the King congratulates all who are interested in your great national charity 
upon the possession of this splendid property, the munificent gift of Sir Thomas 
Devitt and Sir Alfred Yarrow.</i></p>
<p><i>Ever since the Accession of Queen Victoria the orphanage has been closely 
associated with the Royal Family, and his Majesty, now its Patron, does not 
forget that for many years he occupied for many years the office of President.</i></p>
<p><i>The world-wide work of the institution especially appeals to the 
inhabitants of these islands, for it brings within its fostering care the 
necessitous orphans of the seamen of our famous British Merchant Service; and 
the nation may indeed be proud that during the war upwards of 700 vessels in the 
Merchant Service were commanded and officered by those who had been educated and 
trained in your orphanage, and also that some 30 others held commissions in the 
Royal Navy.</i></p>
<p><i>On this important event, which marks a further development in the life of 
the Royal Merchant Seamen’s Orphanage, the King assures you of his heartfelt 
good wishes, confident that in the future it will uphold that high standard and 
great tradition which has characterised the institution for almost a century.</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>(signed) STAMFORDHAM.</i></p>
<p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><b><i>Marlborough House, S.W.1, May 12<sup>th</sup>, 1922</i>,</b></p>
<p><b><i>Dear Sir, - I have laid your letter of the 10<sup>th</sup> inst. Before 
Queen Alexandra, and am desired by her Majesty to say how greatly interested she 
is to know of the acquisition of Bear Wood, Wokingham, for the Royal Merchant 
Seamen’s Orphanage, and to hear that the schools there will be opened on May 17<sup>th</sup>.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Queen Alexandra rejoices to think that as a result of this munificent 
gift the far-reaching and beneficent work of the Merchant Seamen’s Orphanage, in 
which her Majesty has always felt the keenest sympathy, will be carried on under 
such favourable auspices. Her Majesty feels that every effort should be 
forthcoming to promote the welfare of the orphans of our splendid men of the 
Mercantile Marine, whose services to their King and country, especially during 
the Great War, cannot possibly be over-estimated, and her Majesty wishes me to 
convey to the management her earnest hopes for the future prosperity of the 
institution in its new home.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The record of services of the men trained at your schools who were 
engaged during the war, which you are good enough to mention, is, her Majesty 
thinks, a most remarkable one, and one of which the Royal Merchant Seamen’s 
Orphanage may be justly proud.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, </i></b></p>
<p align="right"><b><i>(Signed) HENRY STREATFEILD, Colonel, </i><br><i>Private Secretary to H.M. Queen Alexandra. </i></b></p>
<p>The Marquis of Graham said he was sure that they all appreciated the gracious 
messages which they had received from the King and Queen Alexandra, and that 
they would give him permission to suggest that they send loyal messages thanking 
them for their gracious communications (Applause). </p>
<p>In coming there that beautiful afternoon to see those fine buildings and 
pretty grounds, and all those happy children in the march-past, he could not 
help feeling that it was a great privilege to everyone to be present. In his 
case it was not a privilege, it was an honour he much appreciated. </p>
<p>They knew he was acting as deputy for H.R.H. the Duke of York, who had 
written that he deeply regretted that, owing to the pressure on his time, on 
account of the arrangements in connection with the forthcoming Royal marriage, 
it was necessary for him to cancel an engagement to which he had been looking 
forward with much pleasure. He was deeply interested in all that pertained to 
the men of the sea and all their children, and wished for the school a very 
successful opening and a long and prosperous career. It was, the Marquis 
thought, unnecessary for his Royal Highness to assure them of his interest in 
the children of the orphanage, because he was interested in the welfare of all 
young people in the country. Indeed, the interest of the whole of the Royal 
Family was so well known and appreciated that they had secured for themselves a 
great and abiding place in the love and affection of the people (Cheers). </p>
<p>He ventured to think that the Duke of York’s visit to the orphanage was only 
postponed, and that when he did come he would be assured of a warm welcome 
(Cheers). Continuing, he referred to the fine record of the orphanage, whose 
history was a record of progress following progress. Many great benefactions had 
been received, but the gift of this building and 500 acres of land was so 
splendid that he could scarcely find words with which to express his gratitude. 
Their best thanks were due to Sir Thomas Devitt and Sir Alfred Yarrow for making 
it possible to carry on the work at the institution. (Cheers). </p>
<p>Their names would live in the institution as long as it existed. This was not 
a reformatory or an industrial school; it was a home (Hear, hear) – and it was 
the ambition of the managing body always to turn out boys and girls to be a 
credit to the institution. In the name of his Royal Highness the Duke of York he 
declared the orphanage open, and wished it every success and prosperity 
(Cheers).</p>
<p>Colonel Leslie Wilson, M.P., proposed a vote of thanks to the Marquis of 
Graham, and referred to his Lordship’s thorough knowledge and interest in the 
sea service. </p>
<p>The vote was seconded by Sir Alfred Yarrow, and carried by acclamation, the 
Marquis replying.</p>
<p>Mr. Sturge then formally presented the "F. W. Marten Dining Hall" to the 
managers of the orphanage. He referred to Mr. Marten’s great but unobtrusive 
work as chairman of Lloyd’s, and the enthusiasm with which members of Lloyd’s 
and certain insurance companies welcomed the suggestion of a memorial hall as a 
seamen’s orphanage to one whose life was connected with the sea.</p>
<p>The following inscription is placed on the mantelpiece of the hall: "This 
hall was presented in memory of Frederick William Marten by his friends at 
Lloyd’s, and was dedicated on the 27<sup>th</sup> day of May, 1922, by his Royal 
Highness the Duke of York".</p>
<p>The Marquis of Graham said that he had great pleasure, on behalf of the Duke 
of York, in dedicating the F. W. Marten Hall for the use of the Royal Merchant 
Seamen’s Orphanage.</p>
<p>After the ceremony the guests were entertained to tea on the lawn, during 
which the children gave a very smart display of gymnastics and physical drill. 
Graceful national dances were performed by several of the girls and hornpipes by 
the boys, followed by school singing.</p>
<p>A special train from London conveyed about 130 guests and a number of 
representatives of the Press to Reading, whence they were conveyed in charabancs 
and cars to Bear Wood, under excellent arrangements made by Messrs. Skurray, of 
Reading, whose businesslike organisation and the excellent appointments of their 
cars were favourably commented upon.</p>
