      <p>It all began with an act of&nbsp;generosity.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Miss Jervoise of Targetts Farm</strong> made a Deed of Gift in 
      February 1951 of a parcel of land behind the then <strong>British Legion 
      Hall</strong> (the former <strong><a 
      href="../churches_congregational.htm">Congregational Chapel</a></strong>) <strong>“- to be used in perpetuity for the benefit 
      of the Arborfield &amp; District Branch of the Legion.” </strong> </p>

           We have a plan of the propsed 
      British Legion site dating from 25th February 1949, showing the new land behind 
      the old Congregational Chapel and including a Caretaker's House, with Hart's Cottages and Hillcrest 
      opposite:</p>

            Nothing much happened until 1960, when 
      the British Legion called together a list of village organisations who might be 
      interested to discuss how best to use the land for the benefit of the 
      community:</p>

      to send two representatives, if possible with some guidance from their 
      Committee as to the support that would be forthcoming for this project.

      Here's the original proposed layout as drawn by 
      <strong>Ken Garrett</strong>
               
      &nbsp;on 5th April 1960:</p>
      <p><a href="../images/new/apfa_plan_1.jpg"><img 
      border=0 hspace=0 alt="Plan 5th April 1960"  src ="../images/new/apfa_plan_1_TN.jpg" width=508 height=424 ></a>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>          
                  
                    
                 
               
                
                 
                  
                   
                    
      </p>
      <p>          
                  
                    
                 
               
                
                 
                  
                 A revised 
      plan was drawn up by Ken Garrett on 18th May 1960, after the initial 
      meeting:</p>
      <p><a href="../images/new/apfa_plan_3.jpg"><img 
      border=0 hspace=0 alt="Plan 18th May 1960" src  ="../images/new/apfa_plan_3_TN.jpg" width=533 height=425 ></a>            
                  
                
               </p>
      <p>        
                 
                   
              A committee was formed under 
      the name <strong>"Arborfield Playing Fields Association"</strong>, and met 
      sporadically over the subsequent years. A wish-list of facilities was 
      drawn-up, including <strong>tennis courts</strong>, <strong>bowling 
      greens</strong> and a <strong>children's play area</strong>, and villagers were 
      asked whether they wanted these facilities and if they would use them. 
      Only about a quarter expressed a wish for them, which            
                  
         the Committee felt was insufficient to go 
      ahead at that stage (at an estimated cost of £1,200).</p>
      <p>The ground was more or less levelled&nbsp;and a 
      few&nbsp;shrubs donated by&nbsp;Stephen Sale&nbsp;were planted. By 1964 a 
      Lease was drawn up between the British Legion (as Landlord) and three 
      Officers of the Association (as Tenant), at a peppercorn rent of £1 a year 
      for 21 years (with break-points every 7 years), and at last some 
      playground            
                  
         equipment was planned and erected. Fencing was 
      planned but never installed. The lease listed these six names:</p>
      <p><strong>Stanley Leonard Bowyer</strong> of 52 
      Peach Street Wokingham (Chairman of Arborfield B.L.),<br><strong>Alton 
      Swift Crosley</strong> of Arborfield Court (Hon. Sec. of Arborfield 
      B.L.),<br><strong>Charles Hugh Hatcher</strong>            
                  
                
       of 12 Eversley Road (Hon. Treasurer of Arborfield B.L.);</p>
      <p>            
                  
                
               and</p>
      <p><strong>Euan Oliphant Fleming</strong> of Bridge 
      House, Arborfield,<br><strong>John Henry Harris</strong> of 62 Bearwood 
      Road, Wokingham,<br><strong>Ramsay Leo McKissack</strong>             
                   
                 
                   
           of Grange Cottage, Greensward Lane (all 
      officers of Arborfield Playing Fields Association).<br><br>The Committee continued to 
      meet around once a year, with membership based on the various 
      organisations who might use the site (which resulted in a steady annual 
      turnover in personnel), with the school's headmaster <strong>Mr. 
      Pigott</strong>            
                  
         in the chair. Money was always short, 
      and volunteer labour and committee membership were hard to find.</p>
      <p>    
                 
                 
                  
                 
            In 1967, after there had been some adverse 
      publicity in the local press, the British Legion suggested that they 
      should take the lead to fulfil the intentions behind Miss Jervoise's 
      Will:- <strong>"The land to be used for the benefit of the 
      community"</strong> . Unfortunately,    
                 
                 
                  
                 
                    
                  
                  
               that's not 
      quite what was in the Deed of Gift (as quoted above). This was 
      turning into a comedy of errors.<br><br>By 1971, after some 
      correspondence between <strong><a 
      href="../pictures_shearn.htm">Martin Shearn</a> </strong> (the then Clerk to 
      the Parish Council), and <strong>Blandy &amp; Blandy</strong> (the BL's 
      solicitors), it was realised that the Association was in a hole. It was 
      agreed to terminate the lease and put the assets and liabilities in the 
      hands of the Parish Council, even though the lease seemed to imply that 
      the BL had the right to retain the playground equipment. This gave the BL 
      the freedom to redevelop their land with a <strong>new hall</strong> and 
      <strong>caretaker's flat</strong> - but without <strong>two 
      dwellings</strong> that the BL had wanted 
      to put on the left-hand side of the frontage            
                  
          (now part of the car park) 
      as shown in the following plan dated 28th April 1969:</p>
      <p><a href="../images/new/bl_plan_2.jpg"><img border="0" 
      hspace=0 alt="BL Plan 1969" src="../images/new/bl_plan_2_TN.jpg" width =428 height=536 ></a>     
                  
                 
                      
                  
                   
                    
                   
                    &nbsp; 
      <br><br>The Minute Book was then transferred to the 
      <strong>Parish Council</strong> in May 1971. Apparently, there should then 
      have been a <strong>General Meeting to wind-up the Arborfield Playing 
      Fields Association</strong>            
                  
          , but there's no mention that 
      this ever happened. So does the APFA&nbsp;continue to this day?</p>
