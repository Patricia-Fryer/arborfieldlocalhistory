        Here are some photos of the interior of St. Bartholomew's from the 1994 
        Parish Council Centenary Celebrations. It was decorated with magnificent 
        flower arrangements and tableaux exploring Christian themes, including 
        the large cross as a centrepiece.</p>

        One section of stained glass was salvaged from the old church. It's

        There is a description of Aaron's Head in the Church, which reads (with 
        minor alterations):</p>

      
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This piece of painted glass is all 
  that is left of a Window painted by John Rowell of Reading for Arborfield Old 
  Church. Under the window was this inscription, in a combination of Latin and 
  Greek, here shown in translation:</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">“To the honour of GOD MOST HIGH and 
  to beautify the Church John Waterman, Master of Arts, Rector, gave and 
  dedicated this window decorated with these pictures, and all the Chancel 
  ornamented at his own expense, in the Year of Salvation 1744”.</span></i></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b><a href="churches_rectors.htm">John 
  Waterman</a></b> was Rector from 1739 to 1755.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">John Rowell was celebrated for his 
  stained glass windows and rich colouring, the secret of his wonderful Red died 
  with him in 1756. Of his window in Arborfield Church, the Reverend Charles 
  Coates, L.L.B., writes in his “History and Antiquities of Reading”, 1802 : -</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">“In the Church of Arborfield in 
  Berkshire, is a window over the Altar, of two compartments, in which are 
  represented in half-length, the figures of Moses and Aaron by Rowell, holding 
  the two Tables of the Law. The colours of the Drapery are crimson, blue and 
  purple, all very rich, the breastplate of Aaron is remarkably brilliant”.</span></i></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In taking out this Window in 1863, on 
  the demolition of the Old Church, it was unfortunately broken, and only this 
  portion of Aaron’s Head was saved.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reading Local Studies Library</b> has an engraving

  who died in 1639, and Maria, his wife. The monument was later moved to the new 
  church, on a different site. Print, drawn by E. J. Niemann, and engraved by S. 
  Williams, from "The Environs of Reading" by J. G. Robertson, published in 
  1843'. You can see the engraving by clicking <b>
