<p class="stbody"><strong>Thomas Hargreaves</strong> established himself at
<strong>Arborfield Hall</strong> between 1855 and 1870 as a pillar of the 
community, first becoming a <strong>Magistrate</strong> in 1859, then a <strong>
Sheriff of Berkshire</strong> in 1864 and a <strong>High Sheriff of Berkshire</strong> 
in 1867. In 1870, he set up a new home at <strong>Bishopstoke in Hampshire</strong> 
after his affair with a <strong>Mrs. Warriner</strong> was exposed in a court

	  October 17.</b></i></p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">It is now several years 
	  since the Sessions business of this county has excited such an intense 
	  amount of interest as on this occasion. The proceedings of the last three 
	  Sessions have tended towards closing the Gaol here, and as this was 
	  conceived to be in violation of certain rights which the authorities of 
	  Abingdon are reputed to enjoy by virtue of a deed executed between the 
	  town and county in 1803, a strong effort has been made during the last two 
	  or three months to arrest the progress of any measure having that effect. 
	  Accordingly, upon the representation of the facts to the Earl of Abingdon, 
	  his Lordship gave notice of a motion to rescind the motion for closing the 
	  Gaol. A controversy has also been going on in the shape of pamphlets, and 
	  the interest in the question has increased as the day for the discussion 
	  and reconsideration of the whole matter approached.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Magistrates in this 
	  district arrived some time before the opening of the court, and the body 
	  of the hall was occupied by inhabitants of the town, who are largely 
	  interested in the matter. The mail train from Reading brought also a 
	  considerable number from that division of the county. The attendance of 
	  the magistrates was larger than known for many years. Of those present we 
	  observed the following:-</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Viscount BARRINGTON, 
	  Chairman, Earl of Abingdon, Right Hon, E. P. Bouverie, M.P., Sir R. G.

	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><b>BUSINESS OF THE COURT.</b></p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Owing to the lateness in the

	  judges were Sir Colin Blackburn, and Sir Gillery Pigott. At 10.45 a.m., 
	  Mr. Baron Pigott arrived at the Great Western Station from London, and was
	  <b>met by the High Sheriff, Thomas Hargreaves, Esq., of Arborfield Hall,

	  the Assize Court, and opened the Commission, and afterwards attended 
	  Divine service at St. Lawrence's Church. At 12 o'clock, his Lordship took 
	  his seat in the Crown Court, and proceeded with the trial of prisoners – a 
	  course which has met with general approbation. <b>The High Sheriff – who 
	  was in uniform</b> – the Sheriff's Chaplain, the Under Sheriff, (Mr. W. F. 
	  Blandy), and several County Magistrates, occupied seats on the Bench. </p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The Court was excessively 
	  crowded, and the calendar contained the names of 36 prisoners – 14 of whom 
	  were from the County. Mr. Justice Blackburn did not proceed with the Nisi 
	  Prius business until Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock. After the usual

	  was no opening for him in that county as Master of Fox Hounds, 
	  nevertheless when the opportunity occurred, he continued to hunt the 
	  harriers his father had hunted before him. (Cheers.) Of her Royal Highness

	  severe and painful affliction; and he could state, on the best authority, 
	  that for many many months her Royal Highness must continue suffering and 
	  be shut up from those social enjoyments to which she so largely 
	  contributed. An, in drinking that toast, he was sure that all present

	  Apr 1869: THE PROPOSED SEWAGE FARM AT LOWER EARLEY.</b></p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><b>INFLUENTIAL MEETING IN 
	  OPPOSITION TO THE SCHEME.</b></p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The proposal of the Reading 
	  Local Board of Health to obtain a farm at Lower Earley for the utilization 
	  of the town sewage, is likely to meet with strenuous opposition from the 
	  landowners and inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Earley being essentially 
	  a residential neighbourhood, studded with gentlemen's seats, and one of 
	  the most salubrious portions of the suburbs of Reading, great astonishment 
	  was expressed when it became known that the Board of Health had selected 
	  that particular spot for establishing a sewage farm. It was considered 
	  that if this portion of the sewage scheme were carried into effect it 
	  would be highly detrimental to the parish of Earley. On Tuesday an 
	  influential meeting of the landowners and inhabitants of the parish was 
	  held at the “Three Tuns”, Earley, convened by circular, signed by Mr. 
	  Thomas Porter, of Whiteknights. Among those present were: -</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><b>Captain Hargreaves 
	  (Arborfield Hall)</b>, <b>Rev. Sir John Hayes, Bart., (Arborfield)</b>, 
	  Captain Cobham (Leighton Park), Colonel Blandy, Captain C. Stephens, 
	  Captain Versturme, Messrs. Thomas Porter (Whiteknights), <b>John 
	  Hargreaves (Maiden Erleigh)</b>, J. J. Wheble (Bulmershe Court), A. C. 
	  Cobham (Shinfield), W. Willes (Goodrest), Charles Easton (Whiteknights), 
	  Alfred Waterhouse (Whiteknights), H. Vyse (Wilderness House), Jefferies 
	  (Lower Erleigh), W. W. Cowslade, F. W. Cowslade, J. Galsworthy, F. 
	  Galsworthy, George Sharkel, junr., W. H. Fuller, D. Haslam, J. Minty, W. 
	  Bishop, Goddard, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Mr Thomas Porter occupied 
	  the chair. Mr. Easton explained that proposals had been made by the 
	  Reading Local Board of Health to Sir Francis Goldsmid, Bart., for a lease 
	  of the farm at Lower Earley, for the purpose of the utilization of the 
	  sewage; but if Sir Francis found that the scheme was opposed to the 
	  feelings of the residents in the parish, he certainly would not agree to 
	  the proposal. Mr. Porter, Mr. Easton, Mr. Galsworthy, <b>Mr. J. Hargreaves</b>, 
	  Mr. Willes, and Mr. Vyse spoke strongly in opposition to the sewage being 
	  brought to Earley, and there was a unanimous feeling pervading the meeting 
	  that every legitimate means should be used to prevent the scheme being 
	  carried out.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><b>Mr. J. Hargreaves </b>
	  proposed the following resolution:- “That this meeting views with alarm 
	  the project of the Corporation of reading for establishing a sewage farm 
	  at Lower Earley as being highly detrimental to the property in the 
	  neighbourhood; and that a committee consisting of Messrs. T. Porter, J. J. 
	  Wheble, H. Vyse, A. Waterhouse, J. Hargreaves, <b>Captain Hargreaves</b>,

	  <p class="auto-style6" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">ACTION FOR DAMAGES – 
	  HARGREAVES V. BAKER.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">This was an action brought 
	  by <strong>Captain Hargreaves, of Arborfield Hall</strong>, against
	  <strong>Mr. Baker, brewer, of Wokingham</strong>, for damages sustained to 
	  his carriage, through the alleged careless driving of <strong>Mrs. Baker</strong>. 
	  The damages were laid at £10, 6s. </p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Mr. Huddlestone, Q.C., and 
	  Mr. Dowdeswell were for the plaintiff; and Mr. Powell, Q.C., and Mr. 
	  Griffits [sic] for the defendant. Mr. Huddlestone said the action was not 
	  brought there so much to recover the small amount in dispute, as to try a 
	  principle. There was another cross case to be brought at Oxford for 
	  substantial damages sustained by Mr. Baker. The great point was whether 
	  the carriage was on the right or the wrong side of the road.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Henry Wichelo</strong> 
	  said he was a coachman to Captain Hargreaves. He had been for many years 
	  as coachman to several highly respectable families. His present master 
	  lived at Arborfield Hall. </p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">• He went to meet his master 
	  coming by the train on the 30<sup>th</sup> October, with a carriage drawn 
	  by two horses. <br>•&nbsp; There were three lamps on the carriage. <br>•&nbsp; The footman was 
	  with him, and when his master and mistress got in he drove them homewards.<br>
	  •&nbsp; When he got into the main 
	  road towards Reading, and just before he came to King Street pond, he 
	  observed a man with a donkey cart, and he hallooed to him, and he said he 
	  was all right. <br>•&nbsp; He (witness) kept on the near side all the way home. About 
	  20 yards from the donkey cart, he saw another vehicle coming, and he 
	  hallooed, and instead of pulling the left hand rein the driver pulled the 
	  right, and ran into him, right across the road, and the shaft caught the 
	  wing of the carriage and pulled it off. <br>•&nbsp; He had his horses under perfect 
	  control. <br>•&nbsp; He heard a female speak, and she said, “I beg your pardon; I 
	  pulled the wrong rein”.</p>
	  •&nbsp; He pulled his horses up 
	  immediately, and broke the pole. <br>•&nbsp; He did not know the pole was broken until 
	  he got home. <br>•&nbsp; The master, mistress, and the maid got out of the carriage, 
	  and they went round the carriage, and found Mr. Baker lying between the 
	  wheels of the carriage. <br>•&nbsp; Mrs. Baker fell on the opposite side. <br>
	  •&nbsp; Master spoke 
	  to Mr. Baker, and asked if he was hurt. <br>•&nbsp; Witness's near wheel was within 
	  two feet of the path. <br>•&nbsp; The wing was carried away, and the panel was 
      injured. He was going at the rate of about seven miles an hour.
      <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Cross-examined. – <br>•&nbsp; He had 
	  been waiting at the station for about half-an-hour for his master; <br>•&nbsp; could 
	  not undertake to say that he left the station before a quarter-past seven 
	  o’clock. <br>•&nbsp; He met a man before he came to the donkey-cart. There was nothing 
	  took place between witness and that man. <br>•&nbsp; There was a man and woman at the 
	  cross-roads. <br>•&nbsp; He did not know whether they were walking or riding. He 
	  believed they were in a trap. <br>•&nbsp; A man came to him and said he had a trap. 
	  <br>•&nbsp; Did not hear anybody hallooing out to him before he met Hawkins. <br>
	  •&nbsp; Did not 
	  hear anybody cry out that he was driving furiously before he met Hawkins. <br>
	  •&nbsp; 
	  He kept his horses in the proper track all the way. <br>•&nbsp; He did remember 
	  meeting a four-wheeled vehicle before he met Hawkins, and he pulled 
	  suddenly out of the way. <br>•&nbsp; Could not say how far it was after that before he 
	  met Hawkins. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins was on his proper side, and so was witness. He did 
	  not touch Hawkins’ cart. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins did not say anything to him. Hawkins did 
	  not draw his donkey on the sward on the road-side to get out of witness’s 
	  way. <br>•&nbsp; He did not hear Mr. Baker halloo before he came up. <br>•&nbsp; Mrs. Baker said 
	  she pulled the wrong rein when the collision took place. <br>•&nbsp; She was thrown 
	  out directly. <br>•&nbsp; It was just as the accident happened she made use of this 
	  expression. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker was not so polite. He called him a vagabond, but did 
	  not ask him why he was on the wrong side, nor did he ask him to come down 
	  and give an account of himself. <br>•&nbsp; He did not hear Capt. Hargreaves say, in 
	  reply to Mr. Baker’s questions, that he was a magistrate of the Wokingham 
	  bench. <br>•&nbsp; He never told a man named Paul that he should get out of this 
	  trouble by saying that they pulled the wrong reins. <br>•&nbsp; He had been with Capt. 
	  Hargreaves ever since, and was not under notice to leave. <br>•&nbsp; He had not 
	  understood that his remaining in his present position depended on the 
	  result of this trial.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>William Henry 
	  Matthews</strong>, who was at the time footman to Captain Hargreaves, said 
	  he now lived in Scotland, but he was with the former witness on the night 
	  of the accident. <br>•&nbsp; He saw Mrs. Baker fall out of the vehicle on to the grass 
	  on her own side. <br>•&nbsp; The carriage was stopped immediately. Mr. Baker's vehicle 
	  went on to Wokingham. <br>•&nbsp; When the collision took place, Mr. Baker's vehicle 
	  was knocked back, and the passengers thrown out. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins came up, and 
	  witness observed to him that there was plenty of room to pass. <br>•&nbsp; He 
	  accompanied the bailiff and the Superintendent of Police to the scene of 
	  the accident next morning. <br>•&nbsp; The Superintendent found some splinters, a 
	  strap, and a screw. <br>•&nbsp; Some of the pieces were in the middle, but the 
	  majority were on the near side of the road. <br>•&nbsp; He noticed the track of a 
	  wheel, and it came round askew.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Cross-examined. – <br>•&nbsp; He heard a 
	  person halloo before they met Hawkins. <br>•&nbsp; The coachman did not pull up when 
	  they overtook that person, who had a four-wheeler. <br>•&nbsp; He did not hear the man 
	  halloo more than once.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Captain Hargreaves</strong> 
	  said, the train on this evening was punctual, and he left by the coach for 
	  home four or five minutes afterwards. <br>•&nbsp; There was a sharp turn from the 
	  station road to the main road, and they were obliged to take a sweep 
	  there. <br>•&nbsp; When they came to King-street pond they were not going more than at 
	  the rate of six miles an hour. <br>•&nbsp; When the collision took place the carriage 
	  stopped instantly. <br>•&nbsp; There was an incline down into the pond. <br>
	  •&nbsp; He got out of 
	  the carriage and saw Mr. Baker between the wheels, and if the carriage had 
	  not stopped instantly his head would have been taken off. <br>•&nbsp; <strong>Mrs. 
	  Hargreaves</strong> asked them whether they were hurt. <br>•&nbsp; Some person told 
	  witness Baker’s name. <br>•&nbsp; He “pitched into” Mr. Baker for running into his 
	  carriage. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker appeared to him to be so tipsy that he could answer 
	  nothing that was said to him properly. <br>•&nbsp; Witness told him that he was a 
	  magistrate of the Wokingham Bench, and he should hear from him to-morrow. 
	  <br>•&nbsp; The carriage was on the proper side of the road. <br>•&nbsp; There was no pretence for 
	  saying that Wichelo was going to be turned away.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Cross-examined. – <br>•&nbsp; It did not 
	  occur to him that Mr. Baker’s condition might arise from injuries 
	  sustained. <br>•&nbsp; He could not say whether Mrs. Baker was lying on the ground or 
	  standing. <br>•&nbsp; He thought she was standing and not hurt. <br>•&nbsp; He believed Mr. Baker 
	  asked him his name. Somebody did. <br>•&nbsp; He did not give his name. It was an 
	  omission on his part. <br>•&nbsp; He never heard anybody complain that his carriage 
	  was on the wrong side. <br>•&nbsp; They had a pitched battle in words on both sides. 
	  <br>•&nbsp; He left Mr. Baker on the road after telling him that it would do him good 
	  to walk home. <br>•&nbsp; He did not know how long Mrs. Baker was confined to her bed 
	  afterwards. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins did not point out the position of the carriage, and 
	  tell him that he had no business on the wrong side of the road. <br>•&nbsp; He did not 
	  remember saying to Mr. Baker that there was plenty of room to pass. <br>•&nbsp; No one 
	  pointed out to him that there was plenty of room on the other side of the 
	  carriage. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins did not say to him that he had nearly run into him.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mrs. Hargreaves</strong> 
	  gave corroborative testimony.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mary Hawk (Mrs. 
	  Hargreaves’ maid)</strong> also gave corroborative evidence.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Superintendent 
	  O’Neil</strong> deposed to having gone to the scene of the collision on 
	  the following morning, and found the splinters produced about the middle 
	  of the road, and some rather towards the pond side. <br>•&nbsp; The road measured 
	  there about 19 feet. <br>•&nbsp; Could see a track of a wheel that came from the north 
	  side in an oblique direction, and then it had gone back a little, and was 
	  afterwards lost among the others. <br>•&nbsp; The distance between the north side and 
	  the place where he found the splinters measured 10 feet two inches. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. 
	  Baker came to him after he returned from measuring the place, and told him 
	  about the accident, and said he wished him to see the place. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker 
	  said the accident occurred opposite <strong>Mr. Walter’s cottages</strong>, 
	  which were 500 yards from the spot. <br>•&nbsp; He did not tell Mr. Baker that he had 
	  been to the spot, as he was curious to hear his account of it. <br>•&nbsp; He told Mr. 
	  Baker that he could not go then as he was busy.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>James Complin, 
	  bailiff to Captain Hargreaves</strong>, corroborated the superintendent as 
	  to the finding of the splinters, the width of the road, and the slanting 
	  direction of the wheel tracks referred to.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>- Willits</strong> 
	  deposed to having seen Capt. Hargreaves’ coach leaving the station, and 
	  shortly afterwards he saw Mr. Baker’s trap coming into Wokingham, with no 
	  person in it, and with the wing of a carriage sticking on the off shaft.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mr. Geston, 
	  coachmaker, Longacre</strong>, said the damage done to the carriage, with 
	  the railway fare of the carriage to and from London, amounted to £10 6s.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mr. F. G. Fuller, 
	  surveyor</strong>, gave evidence as to the correctness of the plans 
	  referred to in the course of the evidence for the plaintiff.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">This concluded the 
	  plaintiff’s case.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>John Wigg, surveyor, 
	  residing at Binfield</strong>, made a plan of the road at the scene of the 
	  accident. <br>•&nbsp; The green sward was 18ft. on the one side, and 12ft. on the 
	  other. <br>•&nbsp; There were gutters on both sides. <br>•&nbsp; The part of the road pointed out 
	  by Mr. Hawkins at the pond was 23ft. wide, and it was 19ft. 6in. at the 
	  other points. <br>•&nbsp; There was nothing to prevent a vehicle driving up to the 
	  sward.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mrs. Roselina Baker</strong>, 
	  the wife of the defendant, said she went to Reading on the 20<sup>th</sup> 
	  October last, with a four-wheel chaise, and she had been accustomed to 
	  drive for the last 14 years. <br>•&nbsp; Before she left Reading, she had some tea, 
	  and her husband was with her, and then they went to where the trap was, 
	  and Mr. Baker had a glass of brandy and water. <br>•&nbsp; He was suffering from 
	  erysipelas, and had been so for some months, and was under medical advice 
	  at the time of the accident. <br>•&nbsp; After they had started from Reading, and had 
	  got about half-way, she took the reins, as her husband wished to wrap up. 
	  <br>•&nbsp; She was driving at the rate of about seven miles an hour. <br>
	  •&nbsp; She had been in 
	  the habit of driving along that road three or four times a week. <br>•&nbsp; She saw a 
	  carriage coming along with lamps near the pond, and she drew in as near to 
	  the turf as possible. <br>•&nbsp; She had been keeping to her own side all the way, 
	  but observing that the man did not draw out she drew nearer in. <br>•&nbsp; Her 
	  husband shouted, but the carriage did not draw out from the wrong side 
	  until it touched their vehicle, and then it turned round, and they were 
	  both consequently thrown out. <br>•&nbsp; She was thrown a little distance on the 
	  turf, and Mr. Baker was thrown under the hind-wheel of the plaintiff’s 
	  carriage. <br>•&nbsp; Captain Hargreaves called out to the coachman, “Where are you 
	  driving us to now?” and the plaintiff and the ladies got out. <br>•&nbsp; One lady 
	  came to her, and witness told her she was very much hurt. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker was 
	  seriously hurt, and quite insensible from the effects of a wound in the 
	  head. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins came up, and assisted Mr. Baker. <br>•&nbsp; Witness was unable to get 
	  up without assistance. <br>•&nbsp; Captain Hargreaves said he was a magistrate of 
	  Wokingham, and asked “Who are these people?” <br>•&nbsp; She told him that it was Mr. 
	  Baker, the brewer, of Wokingham. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins then said that he (the plaintiff) 
	  had no business on the wrong side of the road, and that there was not room 
	  for the chaise to pass, pointing to the hind-wheel of the carriage, there 
	  being not four feet between it and the side. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins measured the road 
	  out, and said the carriage had nearly run over his donkey and cart; and 
	  also said there was more than half the road on the other side. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker 
	  asked Captain Hargreaves’ address, and he said he was a Wokingham 
	  magistrate. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker said that would not do for him, and then said to the 
	  coachman “Come down, you vagabond, and give an account of yourself”. <br>•&nbsp; The 
	  carriage drove off directly after that. <br>•&nbsp; She was taken to a cottage nearby. 
	  A person named <b>Cooper</b> kept that cottage. <br>•&nbsp; After some little time her chaise 
	  was brought back to her. <br>•&nbsp; She was ill for six weeks afterwards, her back 
	  injured. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker had not been drinking that day. <br>•&nbsp; He had one of his teeth 
	  knocked out by the accident, another loosened, which came out since, and 
	  he was injured in the head and leg.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Cross-examined. – <br>•&nbsp; She could 
	  not tell the height of the pony which she drove. <br>•&nbsp; It was some distance from 
	  the spot of the collision that she drew the rein. </p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Re-examined. – <br>•&nbsp; She pulled 
	  aside when she saw the lights approaching. <br>•&nbsp; When she was thrown out, the 
	  shock was very violent.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Francis John Baker</strong>, 
	  the defendant, said his pony which his wife was driving, was about 14 
	  hands high. <br>•&nbsp; At the time he started from Reading, he was perfectly sober. 
	  He had been under medical advice. <br>•&nbsp; His wife advised him to wrap up as it 
	  was a cold night, and she then took the reins. <br>•&nbsp; He was about 40 yards or so 
	  from the pond when he saw the carriage. <br>•&nbsp; The carriage was coming very fast. 
	  <br>•&nbsp; He was on his own side, and when he saw the carriage he told his wife to 
	  be careful, and she drew still nearer his side, and he hallooed out for 
	  the driver to keep on his own side, and it came right into them.<br>•&nbsp; He was 
	  thrown into the road. <br>•&nbsp; He found a mark on his leg as if a wheel had gone 
	  over it. <br>•&nbsp; He was rendered insensible. <br>•&nbsp; His wife did not draw the wrong rein, 
	  nor did she say so. <br>•&nbsp; He was picked up by Hawkins. <br>•&nbsp; After he got a little 
	  better, he heard the plaintiff say, “Who are thes people?” and he was 
	  told, and the defendant asked plaintiff who he was, and he said he was a 
	  Wokingham magistrate. <br>•&nbsp; Defendant said that there was no answer to him, and 
	  said to the coachman, “Come down you vagabond; who are you?” <br>•&nbsp; It was very 
	  evident that the carriage had drawn out just as they came to them. <br>•&nbsp; Hawkins 
	  pointed out the position of the carriage. <br>•&nbsp; He was seven or eight inches 
	  from the sward, and the carriage was close to his chaise. <br>•&nbsp; He went to the 
	  spot the next day. <br>•&nbsp; He went to Supt. O'Neil previously. <br>•&nbsp; He went and 
	  measured the gorund himself, with four others, including a 
	  police-constable. <br>•&nbsp; He pointed out the spot, and he could see where his 
	  chaise had been, and where the plaintiff's horses had been plunging about. 
	  Hawkins pointed out the tracks of the wheels of the carriage, and they 
	  were on defendant's side considerably.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Cross-examined. - <br>•&nbsp; He did not 
	  stop on the road to have anything to drink. <br>•&nbsp; The carriage came straight 
	  into them.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">By a Juryman. - He did not 
	  touch the reins at all.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">By Mr. Huddlestone. - He had 
	  met with an accident once before, and owing to his not being able to 
	  obtain his witnesses on that day, he was fined for driving improperly.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mr. Gray</strong> 
	  said he was on the Wokingham road on the night of the accident. <br>•&nbsp; The 
	  carriage when it passed him was on his side of the road. <br>•&nbsp; He called out 
	  several times as loud as he could call, but the coachman took no notice 
	  till he came near to him and witness was obliged to pull his horse and 
	  vehicle on to the green sward. <br>•&nbsp; The carriage pulled right into the middle 
	  of the road when passing, but if witness had not got out of the way, it 
	  would have gone clean over him. <br>•&nbsp; The coachman was going at a rate of 12 
	  miles an hour he believed. <br>•&nbsp; He met the carriage about a mile and a half 
	  from the King-street Pond, on the Wokingham side.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mrs. Gray</strong> 
	  said the carriage was going very fast, and she was frightened. She was in 
	  her husband's cart.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>William Hawkins, a 
	  brick burner and manager of a brick kiln</strong>, said on the night of 
	  the accident he was coming along the Wokingham road with a donkey cart, 
	  with his wife and another woman and child in it. <br>•&nbsp; He led the donkey. <br>
	  •&nbsp; He saw 
	  the lamps of the carriage in the distance. <br>•&nbsp; He was a little on the Reading 
	  side of the pond. He was going to Wokingham. <br>•&nbsp; He was walking on a kind of 
	  footpath at the side, and he was on his own side. <br>•&nbsp; The carriage was on his 
	  side, and he pulled the donkey towards the grass, and when the carriage 
	  came within ten yards, he pushed donkey and cart and all on to the grass.<br>
	  •&nbsp;  
	  If he had not done so, they would have been run over by the carriage. <br>
	  •&nbsp; The 
	  wheel of the carriage was within two feet of his side of the road. <br>•&nbsp; The 
	  women also hallooed out. <br>•&nbsp; The carriage then went on, and he afterwards 
	  heard a smash, and he saw Mr. Baker's trap come between him and the fence 
	  on the greensward, and he was obliged to push his donkey towards the road 
	  again. <br>•&nbsp; When he got to the scene of the accident, he saw the carriage was 
	  on the wrong side, and standing rather askew. <br>•&nbsp; He found Mr. Baker with his 
	  feet in the water track, on his proper side, and his head near the off 
	  hind wheel. <br>•&nbsp; He was trying to get up himself, but could not, and witness 
	  helped him. <br>•&nbsp; Witness's wife then came up and found Mrs. Baker lying on the 
	  greensward. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker appeared to be quite senseless for a minute or two. 
	  <br>•&nbsp; The plaintiff wanted to know who the people were, and he was told by more 
	  than one. <br>•&nbsp; The plaintiff said there was plenty of room, and witness pointed 
	  to the front wheel, which, he said, was only five or six feet from the 
	  turf, and the hind wheel not more than four, and he directed plaintiff's 
	  attention also to the room on the other side. <br>•&nbsp; The plaintiff made no reply 
	  to that. <br>•&nbsp; The coachman never spoke when Mr. Baker addressed him. <br>
	  •&nbsp; Witness 
	  lost his donkey in the scramble, and he looked about for it till nearly 
	  ten o'clock, and at last he found it in a lane. <br>•&nbsp; He afterwards brought a 
	  lantern and examined the road, and found Mr. Baker's whip, and traced the 
	  wheel mark of Mr. Baker's trap for some distance. <br>•&nbsp; He measured the distance 
	  the wheel was from the turf, and it was only six or seven inches all the 
	  way, and on the proper side. <br>•&nbsp; He measured also the position of the 
	  carriage, and the front wheel was five feet from the turf, the hind wheel 
	  was not four feet from it, on Mr. Baker's side. <br>•&nbsp; He also went to the place 
	  next day, but it having rained during the night they could not trace the 
	  carriage wheel marks so well. <br>•&nbsp; He pointed out the spot to the others. <br>
	  •&nbsp; The 
	  gravel was raised by Mr. Baker's wheel. <br>•&nbsp; Mr. Baker was sober enough then.<br>
	  •&nbsp;  
	  Witness had been examined by Mr. Roberts, the plaintiff's solicitor.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Cross-examined. - <br>•&nbsp; He had no 
	  interest in going to the spot, beyond merely to see the place, and to pick 
	  up anything that might have fallen out of the chaise. <br>•&nbsp; <strong>He did not 
	  expect a barrel of beer if Mr. Baker won the case. (Laughter)</strong>. <br>
	  •&nbsp; He 
	  had not been promised it.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mrs. Hawkins</strong> 
	  corroborated the evidence of her husband as to the position of the 
	  garriage, the speed at which it was going, and the danger in which she was 
	  placed while in her donkey-cart.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Cross-examined. - <br>•&nbsp; She saw 
	  Complin, the bailiff, and the footman the next morning, and she pointed 
	  out the green sward on the pond side of the road. <br>•&nbsp; That was wrong. She was 
	  put out about it then. </p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Re-examined. - <br>•&nbsp; It was on the 
	  other side of the road that the donkey was.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Mrs. Fearnall</strong> 
	  also corroborated Mr. Hawkins.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Louis Crew, draper 
	  and grocer, Wokingham</strong>, deposed to having caught Mr. Baker's 
	  horse, and put it up. <br>•&nbsp; He found the carriage wing, and ascertained that the 
	  chaise was injured, and the horse cut. <br>•&nbsp; He saw the wheel track which 
	  Hawkins pointed out, and it was only a few inches from the side, and that 
	  was the right side. </p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Thomas Radford
	  </strong>deposed to having gone with Hawkins, and traced the tracks of the 
	  wheels, and gave corroborative evidence. </p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">After the counsel had 
	  addressed the jury, His Lordship summed up, and said he had never known a 
	  case where the evidence was so conflicting, and irreconcilable.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The jury then retired, and 
	  after deliberating for a considerable time, returned with a verdict for 
	  the defendant.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">This concluded the civil 
	  business, and the Court rose about seven o'clock.</p>
	  <p class="western" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The cross action of <strong>
	  “Baker and Wife v. Hargreaves”</strong>, which was to have been tried at 
	  the Oxford Assizes, was arranged on Wednesday, <strong>by Captain 
	  Hargreaves giving £100 for damages, and paying all costs</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
