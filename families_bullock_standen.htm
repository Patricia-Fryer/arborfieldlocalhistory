<p class="stbody">The story of the sale of the Manor of Arborfield is not without its sad 
interest. It would seem that in consequence of an accumulation of debts 
(described in state papers as partly owed “to the Queen”) <b>Thomas Bullock</b> found 
himself driven to contemplate selling the family estates. To such a course the 
whole family was strongly opposed, and his uncle, <b>George Bullock of Uckfield</b>, 
refused at first to hand over the title deeds, which were in his keeping. 
Ultimately he was obliged to part with them, but only, it would seem, after 
Thomas had, under family pressure, been induced to execute a deed of entail.  </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">This deed, however, he shortly afterwards repudiated, and 
proceeded with the sale. <b>Edmund Standen</b> “of Chancery” father of the better known 
<b>Sir William Standen</b>, became the purchaser for £4000 with the proviso that Thomas 
Bullock should remain in occupation at an annual rent of £150. The validity of 
this sale was at once disputed by his brother and heir presumptive, William, on 
the ground of its being barred by entail. He was however unable to substantiate 
his claim, and after the case had been carried by Standen through the Court of 
Chancery and the Star Chamber, the final verdict was that the alleged entail was 
invalid, and that the sale must hold good.  </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Even then William refused to abandon what he believed to be 
the just rights of himself and the family. In or about the year 1595 Thomas 
died; and William, in defiance of the Star Chamber’s decree - aided and abetted, 
moreover, by the tenants on the Berkshire estates - seems to have entered into 
some degree of possession at Arborfield.<br>
<br>
In “BARKHAM: A History” we read that William.....seized possession of the manor 
house and mill at Arborfield. When Standen’s agents attempted to take possession 
of the mill, William’s servants inside the building threw scalding water over 
them.<br>
<br>
This action involved him in serious contempt of Court, with the result that he 
was thrown into Fleet Prison. While in confinement he brought further actions 
for the recovery of the estate, first in the Queen’s Bench, and then in the 
Court of Common Pleas, and followed up these by Petitions to the Queen, the 
Privy Council and the ‘Lord Keeper’. in these proceedings he appears to have had 
the sympathy and active support of “his wife, children, kinsfolk and friends” - 
including his cousins, <b>William and Thomas Kingsmill</b>, grandsons of the late 
Justice of the Common Pleas. But all their persistence was in vain, and, William 
Bullock remained for several years a prisoner. It is only from the Parish 
Registers of Barkham that we learn that he finally gave way, and returned to his 
home in that village, where in 1603 his youngest daughter was born.<br>
<br>
Thus with the passing of the 16th century the Arborfield Estate passed from the 
Bullock family into the hands of the Standens, in whose possession it remained 
for some 150 years.<br>
