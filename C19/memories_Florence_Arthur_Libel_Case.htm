	  While his wife <strong>Sarah Hargreaves</strong> had been bringing up 
	  their family at <strong>Arborfield Hall</strong>, <strong>Thomas 
	  Hargreaves</strong> was living apart at <strong>The Mount, Bishopstoke</strong>, 
	  and had been in a relationship with <strong>Mrs. Geraldine Bertha Warriner</strong> 
	  until her death in 1885.<br><br>It seems from a libel case in April 1887 
	  that Thomas had then taken up with a young lady named <strong>Florence 
	  Arthur</strong>. His relationship with her was made public during a libel 
	  case which hinged around a letter that Florence had written to him in 
	  private, but the letter was opened by Florence's sister and thus made 
	  public. The libel case was reported in several publications including the
	  <strong>Pall Mall Gazette</strong>, <strong>London Standard</strong>,
	  <strong>Hampshire Advertiser</strong>, and the <strong>Illustrated Police 
	  News</strong>, where the following article appeared on 30th April 1887:<p class="auto-style2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	  <strong>ALLEGED LIBEL</strong></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At the Marylebone 
	  Police-court, on Tuesday, Miss Florence Arthur, aged twenty-nine, a lady 
	  residing at 11, Park-village East, Gloucester Gate, Regent's Park was 
	  charged on a warrant, having failed to answer a summons, for maliciously 
	  publishing a defamatory libel concerning Mr. Thomas Ratcliffe. A counsel 
	  conducted the case for the complainant, and Mr. Mann, solicitor, defended.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Captain Thomas Hargraves 
	  [sic], of The Mount, Bishopstoke, said he had known both the complainant 
	  and the defendant for a long time. The letters produced were in Miss 
	  Arthur's handwriting. Witness received them while yachting off Ramsgate, 
	  about October last year. After having read the letters he caused them to 
	  be forwarded to Mr. Ratcliffe, the complainant.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The learned counsel then 
	  read one of the letters in question, in which the writer cast serious 
	  reflections on the moral character of the complainant and his wife, who is 
	  the defendant's sister, and suggested that Captain Hargraves should 
	  consult members of the Junior Carlton Club as to the complainant leaving 
	  it. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Cross-examined: Mrs. 
	  Ratcliffe was on board witness' yacht when the letters were received. In 
	  fact, he believed they were handed her from shore, and seeing one in her 
	  sister's handwriting she opened it, although it was addressed to witness. 
	  He certainly did not regard it as “private and confidential”. He thought 
	  the two sisters would become friends again. He (witness) had no 
	  ill-feelings in the matter. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Mann: Has not Florence 
	  Arthur, my client, occupied the position of your wife? Captain Hargraves: 
	  Well, really, what do mean? She's not my wife. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Mann: You know well 
	  enough what I mean. Has she not occupied the position of your wife? 
	  Captain Hargraves: I swear not. She has visited me at times. She has 
	  occupied the position of another man's wife. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Mann: Was defendant not 
	  living with you, shortly before this letter was received, as your wife? 
	  Captain Hargraves: I never considered her my wife. I refuse to answer 
	  these questions. (To the Magistrate): Am I obliged to answer them? </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Mann: <strong>Have you 
	  not written to the defendant, and called her “My dear wife?” Captain 
	  Hargraves: I might have done so. </strong></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Mann: Here is one of 
	  your letters (produced), in which the words appear. Further 
	  cross-examined, the witness said there was a serious breach between 
	  himself and the defendant before October last year. Mr. Bedford was his 
	  solicitor, and he was conducting this prosecution. He believed that all 
	  the complainant wanted was an apology from the defendant. The witness was 
	  being examined as to some civil proceedings pending when counsel objected.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Mann remarked that
	  <strong>letters between a man and his wife had been held to be privileged</strong>, 
	  and he should show that the defendant was occupying the position of wife 
	  to the witness at the time she wrote the letters to him. Re-examined: The 
	  defendant had stayed with him for a few days at a time. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The complainant had just 
	  entered the witness-box in order to give evidence, when the court 
	  adjourned for luncheon. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Later in the afternoon the 
	  learned gentleman made a statement to the effect that, as the defendant 
	  had expressed regret for what she had written, the prosecutor wished to 
	  withdraw the case. Mr. De Retzen said he thought that a wise course to 
	  pursue, and allowed the case to be withdrawn. </p>
