<b>'Wryneck'</b> was the pen-name for a hunting correspondent who wrote the 
'Hunting Notes' column in the 'Reading Mercury' in the early 1920's. His 
detailed reports started appearing in late 1921, and there were many covering 
the Arborfield area that year and through 1922.<p>On December 31<sup>st</sup> 
1921, ‘Wryneck’ gave the following advice to those following the hunt on foot 
rather than from their armchairs:</p>
<p align="center"><i><b><font size="4">ADVICE GRATIS</font></b></i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>To Motorists</b> – Although you may be the largest subscribers to the 
hunt (or perhaps subscribe not at all), curb your fiery steeds when hounds are 
drawing, and let not your engines run alongside covert. Foxes probably object 
strongly to a noisy engine, and are unlikely to break in face of a raging petrol 
fiend.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>To Push-bike and Foot Followers</b> – Remember that (with few 
exceptions) you don’t pay one cent for your sport. You are getting a lot of fun 
at other people’s expense. Try therefore to repay the obligation by helping as 
much as you can; do not get round covert and <b>holloa</b> in the face of a 
breaking fox; do not get in the way of the hounds and hunt servants or mounted 
field; and, when you have seen no fox or when hounds are running well, do not 
mislead the huntsman by <b>view holloas</b>, however tuneful, merely to show you 
can do it better than the other chap.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Never <b>holloa</b> unless you see a fox yourself. Take nobody else’s word 
for it. If you do, you may find yourself <b>holloaing </b>a hare and get the 
blame; <b>and serve you ---- well right.</b></i></p>

<p>Here are a few reports from 1922:</p>
       
<p>February 4th 1922: Hunting Notes, by ‘Wryneck’: </p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Garth Hunt at Arborfield</font></b></p>
<p>Wednesday, January 25<sup>th</sup> – Tuesday’s hard frost, in spite of a thaw 
towards Wednesday morning, made hunting impossible and hounds remained at home.</p>
<p>Thursday, January 26<sup>th</sup> – The Master, not to be defeated by 
Tuesday’s frost, put back his Wednesday fixture a day and brought the dog pack 
to Arborfield Cross. First, Bottom Wood was drawn blank, and then, as hounds 
went into Round Wood, a fine fox went away at the far end almost before the 
whips could take their stations. Hounds coming out on the line at first did not 
own it with any great confidence, but crossing the road and getting on a field 
of clover stubble, scent improved and they drove along toward Arborfield at a 
nice pace. </p>
<p>It seemed as though the fox were headed as he topped the high ground behind 
Arborfield Cross, for he swung round left-handed in an undecided way; then, 
making up his mind, he crossed the road near Arborfield Church on to the 
Arborfield Hall farm, pointing for Carter’s Hill. </p>
<p>For half the distance to Carter’s Hill farm, hounds skipped along very 
nicely, and it looked all odds on a good run, but suddenly they were at fault, 
and though the Master made every possible cast, they could not hit off the line 
again. A good many people professed to have viewed him, but their reports 
differed, so that they were not much help. </p>
<p>Then back to May’s Farm and drew Moor Copse blank, and on into Swallowfield 
Park, where a fox was found in Big Wood. This customer gave them a short spin 
and went over the river, the field crossing at the ford, and was lost. Then 
drawing on towards Farley Hill, a third fox was found in West Wood. After 
turning a bit in this covert and Robin Wood covert, he went away for West Court. 
Either scent was getting poor or he was some time ahead of the pack, as hounds 
were hunting as though on a cold line. Coming to the boundary spinney of West 
Court Park, they could make nothing of it, and had to give up. Not by any means 
a bad day. Plenty of foxes about and hounds always busy. With any luck, better 
sport would have been shown by the first fox.</p>
<p>Wednesday – Hounds met at Finchampstead, the Master carrying the horn. First 
drew the Fleet, blank, and then over the road to the Thrift. From there a fox 
stole away at once before hounds were hardly in covert – probably a visitor bent 
on courting – and went over Wheatlands pointing for Long Moor. </p>
<p>Crossing the Nine-Mile-Ride and run the line leading towards Barkham, and 
looked as though his point would be Kidgems Wood; but, swinging away a bit to 
the right with Barkham Square and the church on his left, he made for Foxhills. 
Running the new plough land that borders Foxhills on this side hounds were right 
on his brush, and would certainly have pulled him down at the edge of the covert 
had it not been for the rabbit-netting, which held up hounds and enabled the 
varmint to get to ground in an earth just inside the young fir plantation. Every 
effort was made to get him out, but the earth proved to be an impossible place 
with ramifications over half the county, and so he saved his brush. </p>
<p>Meanwhile hounds were thrown into the Coombs [sic], drawing up from the 
bottom towards Bear Wood. A leash of foxes at least were presently on foot, but 
hounds settled on the line of a little vixen, the same, or own sister to the 
one, that gave them the spin last Saturday. Scent was poor here in covert, 
however, and after hunting their fox about the Coombs for nearly an hour they 
ran themselves out of scent and had to give up. It was hard luck to be 
disappointed of their morning fox. At times they slipped along very nicely, and 
on the burnt lands hunted patiently and most steadily. A very nice hunting run 
of one hour and 40 minutes.</p>

  <p>February 25th 1922: Hunting Notes, by ‘Wryneck’: </p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Garth Hunt</font></b></p>
<p>On Wednesday, met at Sindlesham Mill House. Hounds were put into the withy 
beds on the Loddon, and found almost at once. </p>
<p>The fox went away on the hill and crossing the road near the Mole Inn went 
into Bear Wood. Then the usual thing happened. Half a dozen foxes were on foot 
and went running in every direction, and probably several were hunted. At length 
one was marked to ground, and while digging was in progress, hounds went on and 
drew the Coombs. Here a group of foxes were disturbed. One went across the ride 
into Bear Wood, and hounds, getting on the line of the other, pushed him out at 
the bottom end, and had him in the open, but ringing round short of Newlands he 
also got into Bear Wood and after twenty minutes there, was lost.</p>
<p>Then they moved off to Arborfield Hall Park, and drew the Riverside coverts, 
but did not find. Next going over the Shinfield Road, they drew the Russell 
Estate coverts. Bottom Wood, Round Wood, Moor Copse and Big Wood, all blank. So 
leaving Swallowfield Park they went into the Farley Hill Covers. Presently a 
hound opened, and the pack confirmed it, but they could make nothing of him, 
when suddenly a distant ‘holloa’ right over the hill, gave notice that the 
varmint had left West Wood (He must have slipped away directly he heard hounds 
about, a not uncommon experience in February, when foxes are often away from 
their home coverts). The Master, lifting the hounds to the holloa, then hit off 
the line and, with a burning scent, went off at a rare pace, heading for Bear 
Wood. It was over a nice bit of country, and they were running very fast, but 
all too soon the varmint was in covert, and they were brought to hunting. </p>
<p>Now engaged as fine a bit of steady hound work as one could well wish to see. 
For two and a half hours of woodland hunting they stuck to their fox, round the 
Coombs, then across into Bear Wood, past the lake, and on to the Lodges, over 
the road into Foxhills, back into Bear Wood, then to the Coombs again, out at 
the lower end and across the grass-land right-handed and, swinging round short 
of Newlands House, into Bear Wood again. Once more through and into Foxhills, 
and then into the open pointing for Emmbrook. </p>
<p>Headed most unfortunately by a yelling boy, the fox went back into Foxhills; 
over the road again and into Bear Wood, past the lake, and left-handed once 
again into the Coombs where hounds were stopped at ten minutes to six, and a 
thoroughly beaten fox saved his brush. </p>
<p>A very fine performance. No muddling along from hollow to hollow, but 
beautiful steady line hunting; pace very good for the difficult nature of the 
ground they went over; and some grand music. A rattlingly good day. Horses and 
hounds had had enough, and men too. To finish the day, hounds were rewarded with 
the customer they had marked to ground in the morning. A tough old varmint he 
was, too.</p>

  <p>November 25th 1922: OCCASIONAL HUNTING NOTES: </p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">THE GARTH, WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 23</font><sup><font size="4">RD</font></sup></b></p>
<p>Met at Newlands. First drew the Coombs, but did not find. Then on to Carter’s 
Hill. Here a brace of foxes were soon afoot, and, after two attempts to break on 
the Coombs side of cover, one at length got away toward Sindlesham Mill; then 
swinging up the hill right-handed, he made for Bear Wood. In covert, he was here 
joined by a fresh fox, and they ran for a short while in company when, finding 
an open drain near the lake, one at last was viewed to ground there; the other 
being lost probably in the thick bush round the water.</p>
<p>Finding again in Bear Wood, and hunting the line steadily, they next pushed a 
fox over the road near the pumping station, and away down to Carter’s Hill. 
Driving him through the coverts there they hunted him along the Loddon towards 
Arborfield, and getting him into the open from the Gorse, near the Grange, they 
pulled him down in the big field behind Arborfield Church.</p>
<p>Without waste of time, hounds were then thrown into the Rectory Covert, and 
immediately had a good fox on the move in front of them. The line went across 
the Shinfield – Arborfield road, on to the Swallowfield Estate, through Round 
Wood and across the open as though for Farley Hill; then leaving Swallowfield 
Big Wood on their right and sinking the hill they crossed Green Ride into the 
Remount pastures, on over the Barkham Road, with West Court on their right, and 
so into Long Moor when, bending left-handed, they carried the line into Kidgems.</p>
<p>Scent, catchy at the best, was poor in covert, and they were at some 
difficulty to keep on the covert from end to end, came away at the lower, or 
Barkham, end, making for the Coombs. Here he was viewed and <i><b>holloa’d</b></i>, 
but it was some minutes before Daniels could get hold of hounds, and get them 
out of covert, and a scent by no means good was somewhat cooled when they hit 
the line again. However, after some hesitation, they owned the line and ran with 
fair confidence to the Coombs. In this covert scent failed almost entirely, and 
possibly their fox had got to ground; and with dusk coming on, it was decided to 
take hounds home.</p>
<p>Not at all a bad day. Considering the scent, hounds hunted very well indeed; 
and the afternoon provided some excellent sport.</p>

<p>The final article was on December 23rd 1922: </p>
       
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">"WRYNECK’S" ACCIDENT</font></b></p>
       
<p>Our readers will regret to hear that our hunting correspondent, "Wryneck", 
met with a serious accident, whilst following the Garth Hounds recently. </p>
<p>In trying to avoid a motor-car, he fell from his bicycle and splintered his 
kneecap in three places. An operation was necessary and was successfully 
performed, but recovery is necessarily a slow process, and it is doubtful 
whether he will be able to leave the Maidenhead Cottage Hospital until after 
Christmas. He hopes to continue his "Hunting Notes" in the New Year.</p>
