<p>The War Office have decided to close down the <b>Remount Depot at Arborfield

new jobs. </p>
<p>The Depot, which was one of the few remaining centres for Army horses 
in the country, has been in existence for 32 years. When it was started in 1904, 
it consisted of a few sheds only, but now it covers an area of about <b>500 acres</b>, 
with substantially built houses and stables. </p>
<p>Altogether between <b>90,000 and 100,000 horses</b> have passed through the 
depot during its existence. Its greatest usefulness was during the <b>
<a href="../WW1/WW1_Remount_Depot.htm">period of the

eventually to the various battlefields. Since the war an average of 2,000 horses 
have been dealt with annually, and at the present time <b>there are 250 horses 
kept in condition ready for service</b>. This will disappear with the depot.</p>
<p>The present commanding officer is <b>Brig.-Gen. C. C. Lucas, M.C.</b> The 
closing of his depot will be a great loss to tradesmen and others in the 
district, particularly to farmers, who have been in the habit of supplying the 
depot with large quantities of fodder each year.</p>

<p align="center">The Future Uncertain</p>

<p>An official of the Depot told our representative: "We have no idea of what is 
going to happen to the Depot. All we know is that as a remount depot it will be 
closed on March 31st. Whether it will ultimately be decided to sell the land 
which comprises the depot or to utilise it for the new mechanised army we are 
not in a position to state".</p>

<p align="center"><b>Letter: The Closing Down of the Remount Depot</b> </p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>To the Editor of the "Reading Mercury, Berks.’ County Paper":</p>
<p>Sir – It will be in the knowledge of many of your readers that on March 31<sup>st</sup> 
next the Army Remount Depot at Arborfield is closing down, thereby throwing out 
of employment a large number of men. Many of these men are members of the <b>
Newland, Arborfield and Barkham branch of the British Legion</b>, of which I 
have the honour to be the chairman.</p>
<p>May I, through the hospitality of your columns, appeal to employers of labour 
in the county to come to their assistance? Those of your readers who are members 
of the British Legion know of that splendid spirit of comradeship that obtains 
throughout its ranks, and will share something of the dismay that fills my heart 
at this blow that has fallen on so many of the households of our little 
villages.</p>
<p>If the good and cheerful work which my fellow members of this branch have 
invariably and ungrudgingly given on behalf of their stricken comrades of the 
Great War is any criterion of their worth, then I am convinced that no employer 
need fear that his confidence will be misplaced in giving these good fellows a 
chance of employment. Please send your inquiries to me at the address below. </p>
<p>I am sir, yours faithfully, </p>
<p><b>(Major) Henry S. Morris, <br>Newland, Arborfield and Barkham Branch of the 
British Legion,<br> Longmoor Cottage, Barkham, near Wokingham.</b></p>

<p>Report on Arborfield British Legion’s 6<sup>th</sup> annual dinner</b> held at the Village Hall on 
      the previous Saturday: Nearly 90 sat for dinner; 117 financial members. 
      </p>
<p>There was an initiative to start raising money for a Benevolent Fund. <b>Col. 
A. E. Porch</b> (county vice-chairman) said that ‘the British Legion were doing 
all they could, and were in direct communication with the War Office, in regards 
to the closing of the Remount Depot, which was casting such a cloud upon so many 
of the members and ex-Servicemen employed there, adding that everything possible 
was being done for their welfare’.</p>

<p align="center">The Remount Depot at Arborfield</p>
<p align="center">Sir Ralph Glyn’s Question in Parliament</p>
</b>
</font>
<font size="2">
<p><b>Major Sir Ralph Glyn</b>, Member for North Berks., asked the Secretary of State 
for War in Parliament on Tuesday how many men had been discharged or were under 
notice to leave the <b>remount depot at Arborfield, Berkshire</b>; what was their 
average length of service both in the Army and since joining the reserve, and 
what steps were to be taken to find them suitable employment, bearing in mind 
that they had no trade other than horse management.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Duff-Cooper</b> replied: "The reduction and reorganisation of the remount 
service resulting from the increased mechanisation of the Army will entail a 
reduction in the establishment of the Arborfield depot on March 31<sup>st</sup> 
next. There will be a further reduction probably not later than June next, when 
it is likely that the depot will have closed down. </p>
<p>"All employees have been warned of the early closing of the depot, but apart 
from normal establishment fluctuations, no men at the depot have been discharged 
or given notice to leave, as it is not yet known what the requirements of the 
reorganised service will be or how many men can be absorbed in other than Army 
occupations. The second part of the question does not, therefore, arise."</p>

	  <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1937/mar/16/british-army-arborfield-remount-depot">
	  Hansard on 16th March</a></strong> gave a little more detail of the 
	  numbers involved: <br><br><strong><em>Brigadier-General Brown</em></strong><em> 
	  asked the </em><strong><em>Secretary of State for War</em></strong><em> 
	  how many of the employés at Arborfield remount depot have been given 
	  notice to terminate their employment; how many of these men have now found 
	  work or been provided with another job; and how many of these men are 
	  ex-service men?<br><br></em><strong><em>Mr. Cooper:</em></strong><em> 
	  Notice has been given to all the 161 employés at the Arborfield remount 
	  depot, of whom 147 are ex-service men; 82 have been found or have found 
	  employment, of whom 78 are ex-service men. A further 68 employés, of whom 
	  65 are ex-service men, will be retained at Arborfield remount depot until 
	  the depot is closed.</em><br></p>

<p>The closure took place later in 1937, but the site then became an Ordnance 
Depot and the site of the Army Technical School. On <font size="2">February 25<sup>th</sup>: 
1938, the 'Times and Weekly News' reported:</font></p>
       
<p><font size="2"><b>'The Garth Hunt Point-to-Point races</b> will take place on 
the course of the <b>Army Ordnance Depot (late Remount)</b> at Arborfield on 
Tuesday March 29<sup>th</sup>. There will be the usual six events. We understand 
that another military or adjacent hunt point-to-point will be held there at a 
later date. It is greatly appreciated that the converting of the Remount into an 
Army Ordnance Depot has not yet affected these popular <b>
<a href="../memories_garth_p2p.htm">point-to-point meetings</a></b>, but there 
are rumours that this year’s events will bring them to a close.'</font></p>
       
<font size="2">
<p>On March 11<sup>th</sup> 1938, this newspaper noted that <b>Licences were 
granted for two Point-to-Point meetings at the Ordnance Depot:</b> the <b>Garth
</b>on March 29<sup>th</sup> and the <b>Berks and Bucks Stag-hounds</b> on April 
16<sup>th</sup>. Both events were covered in detail by the paper.</p>

<p>The April 1st issue noted that the<font size="2"><strong> </strong><a

      Society</strong></a> met at the Village Hall to plan the Annual Flower Show, which 
could no longer be held at the old Remount Depot. Many members who had been
