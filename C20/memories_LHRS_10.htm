This is the tenth and last article for Arborfield in the Berkshire <b>Local History Recording Scheme</b>, 
reference A6-10:<p align="center"><b><font size="4">'Historic Arborfield 
Exhibition'</font></b></p>
<font size="4">
<p align="center"><b>(Organised by Mr B. Ridler)</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>The purpose behind this exhibition which was staged at one end of a produce 
tent at the annual Arborfield and District Flower [Show] held in the British 
Legion Field, was twofold. Firstly to stimulate interest in the history of 
Arborfield and secondly, arising from this, to catalogue all possible sources of 
material relating to the history of the village. Both these objects were largely 
achieved; visitors thronged the stand during most of the afternoon, while the 
variety and number of the exhibits shown, with additional material mentioned to 
the organiser since the exhibition, indicated that a high proportion of the 
available data on Arborfield had been brought to light.</p>
<p>Thus, it may be claimed that the exhibition did give in a general way some 
idea of life amongst all sections of the village community through the 
centuries. Life, which to a very large extent, centred round those two 
persistent bastions, the Church and the Manor.</p>
<p>It was fitting therefore that pride of place should be given to these two 
sections representing as they did some of the earliest evidence of Arborfield in 
the remote past. The other main sections were The Village, The School, and the 
Simonds Family.</p>
<p>The material itself was obtained from a variety of sources. A considerable 
amount, particularly photographs, paintings, books, etc., from ordinary village 
folk. The Rector, the Rev. C. H. Wilson, not only lent some very interesting and 
valuable church furniture, but also sent along Mr W. Cox, the verger, as 
watchdog and compere.</p>
<p>The organisation of the Simonds collection was made possible through the very 
generous help and untiring interest of Mrs. B. Simonds [sic]. The help of Major Maurice Simonds 
and Miss Simonds is also gratefully acknowledged.</p>
<p>Where obvious gaps existed, these were filled by using continuity extracts 
from newspapers, Record Office documents and parish magazines. Items from the 
private collection of the organiser were also used.</p>
<p>To give a brief summary of the various sections: the antiquity of the church 
was demonstrated with a list of Rectors from 1222, while 17<sup>th</sup> century 
plate and a Victorian hand organ were interesting links with the present day. 
Prominent in an album of old photographs were two of the longest holders of the 
living, Sir J. W. Hayes (1839-1880), and Canon J.A. Anderson (1898-1945).</p>
<p>The descent of the manor through three families only in the 700 years from 
1166 was shown, and also considerable data relating to the colourful Victorian 
squire Sir John Conroy, soldier, courtier and agriculturalist who rebuilt 
Arborfield Hall. An exhibit which may have been connected with the Yorkshire 
holder of the manor, George Dawson, was a Lancashire halfpenny tradesman’s token 
of 1732, retrieved from the garden of one of the lodges.</p>
<p>The earliest record of village life was that of an unfortunate Arborfield 
debtor who belatedly received the Royal pardon after his death in Fleet prison 
in 1438, Three centuries later two Royal occasions are recorded: George the 
Third in pursuit of a stag through Arborfield in 1786; and Queen Victoria in 
1845 baiting her horses at the Bull Inn, en route to visit the Duke of 
Wellington at Stratfieldsaye. Moving into the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> 
centuries social documentation became more varied. Overseers’ accounts, 
population figures, and the fetes and junketings at jubilees and coronations; 
events during the 1914-18 war; the formation in the early 1920’s of the Women’s 
Institute, British Legion and other village bodies; and lastly the erection of 
the village hall in the thirties.</p>
<p>Of school life, a copy of the document recording the foundation of the church 
school in 1840 was exhibited, together with a beautifully-kept copy-book of 
1860, and also a late Victorian log-book.</p>
<p>Members of the Simonds family have lived at Newlands for centuries and this 
fact was illustrated with two Queen Anne deeds. Also shown were early 19<sup>th</sup> 
century autograph letters to members of the Simonds family from the Duke of 
Clarence later William the Fourth and his brother the Duke of York. In addition 
there were daguerrotypes of members of the family and old Newlands house, and 
coming to the present day many social and sporting documents culminating in the 
imposing Freedom casket presented to the late Mr John Simonds by the Borough of 
Reading in 1924.</p>
