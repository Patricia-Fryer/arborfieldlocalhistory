&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">In 1630, hunting at Bearwood was not as good as it 
        might have been because stocks of game were low. So when the King 
        (Charles I) sold off part of Windsor Forest, he decided to replenish the 
        herd. Because he feared that they would wander off, he ordered Sir 
        Francis Knolly and Richard Arrowsmith, joint keepers of the Bearwood 
        Walke, to fence the animals in. </font> </p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">One hundred and twenty acres of forest were enclosed 
        and a lodge built for the keepers - (built in the 16th Century, some 
        people believe that Langley Pond Farmhouse could have been one of the 
        royal hunting lodges, due to the one complete roof as only a person with 
        wealth could have afforded that type of structure) but this was resented 
        by the people of Newland, Sindlesham and Winnersh. They had lost their 
        rights of “free chase”, enjoyed when the Bishop of Salisbury held the 
        land. One night, after dark, the people met together and “riotously 
        pulled the fence down” They also petitioned to have the lodge removed.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">When the Civil War came (1642-9), the Royal landlords 
        had more urgent things to worry about than hunting rights at Bearwood. 
        During this war most of the deer were killed off and the lodge was 
        demolished in 1655. The land at Bearwood remained part of the forest of 
        Windsor and the people of the area reclaimed their rights. </font> </p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">Thomas Pride's Map of 1790 (below) shows Bearwood as 'Bare 
        Wood', whereas the Enclosure map of 1817 spells it 'Bere Wood', as you

        Jacobean, with red brick and gables manufactured from clay and timber on 
        the 17,500 acre estate, to go with Bear Wood - the vast mansion". It 
        continues: "Robert Kerr's plans for the big house included such 
        contemporary necessities as gaming room, brushing room, deed room and 
        butler's corridor; while the estate village had its own pub [<b>the Walter

        <p class="sthead" align="center"><i><font size="4">-----</font></i></p>
        <p>I<i>n a sympathetic memorial notice of the late Mr. Walter, the Field of 
        Saturday says: As proprietor of the family estate of Bear Wood, Mr. 
        Walter was known as a generous and considerate landlord, and took a keen 
        interest in all matters calculated to promote the welfare of the 
        district. All his life he remained a retiring, modest, hard-working man, 
        whose real kindness of heart was often as much concealed from casual 
        acquaintances. Those who have had the privilege of enjoying the 
        hospitality of Bear Wood will not easily forget the sincere and genial 
        welcome they received from one who will be missed in many forms of 
        county activity and innate beneficence. Mr. Walter possessed that innate 
        scholarship of brain and temperament which lasts through every 
        vicissitude of life. His rectitude of purpose and integrity of action 
        were not the least of those qualities which commanded the respect of all 
        who knew him.</i></p>
        <p><i>Bear Wood is not an ancient estate, but it has been made historic on 
        account of its possession by the maker and founders of a newspaper which 
        has become a national institution and exercises a world-wide influence.
        <b>The founder of The Times</b> was <b>John Walter I</b>, who dying in 
        1812, was succeeded by his son <b>John Walter II</b>, who showed a strong and 
        purposeful personality, and developed the newspaper enormously by 
        establishing its individuality and causing it to be the medium for the 
        expression of unbiased political opinion. Prosperity dawned, and he 
        decided to found a country house. The neighbourhood of Wokingham 
        attracted him, and before his death in 1837 he purchased from the Crown 
        a portion of the old Windsor Forest near the village of Sindlesham, and 
        in that pleasant district reared for himself a comfortable house.</i></p>
        <p><i>Bear Wood is an ancient name. The Forest of Windsor in the time of 
        King James I, was divided into "walkes", of which there were sixteen. 
        Norden’s map of the forest shows the Beare Wood Walke on the west of the 
        forest, bordering on the river Loddon, and embracing Winnersh, Newlands, 
        Arborfield, and Barkham. It was stocked with fallow deer, and the keeper 
        was Sir Francis Knollys.</i></p>
        <p><i>The land which now constitutes the Park of Bear Wood remained Crown 
        lands until it was purchased by <b><a href="families_john_walter_2.htm">Mr. John Walter II</a></b>, about the 
        year 1830. Some of the giant beeches, when felled, disclosed beneath the 
        bark the Royal Arms that had been stamped upon them more than a century 
        ago.</i></p>
        <p><i>Besides building the house, Mr. Walter erected the church of Bear 
        Wood and attached to it a separate parish, constituting it a rectory. 
        The <b>third John Walter</b> began his reign in 1837, and ruled till 
        1894. During that period of nearly 60 years he raised The Times 
        to the zenith of its fame, erected at Bear Wood an immense Mansion, and 
        formed by gradual purchase a great estate, monuments of the position won 
        by the Walter family as faithful servants of the public, and honourable 
        conductors of the greatest newspaper in the world.</i></p>
        <p><i>A characteristic story is told of the building of this house. There 
        was a strike of bricklayers, but Mr. Walter was not a man to be beaten 
        by labour troubles. He at once mounted the scaffolding and began to lay 
        the bricks with his own hands. "You see, I can get on without you", he 
        said, turning to the men on strike, who were watching him; "it will take 
        a little longer, perhaps, but I shall get it done in the end". The men 
        returned to their work forthwith, and there were no more strikes at Bear 
        Wood.</i></p>
        <p><i>The plan of Bear Wood mansion is so arranged that a large picture 
        gallery forms the central and principal chamber, wherein is placed a 
        notable collection of paintings, chiefly of the Dutch school. The ground 
        immediately around the house are laid out with much skill, showing Mr. 
        Walter’s taste for landscape gardening, a taste which was inherited by 
        his son who has jus<a href="images/Bearwood/College/South%20Front%20with%20Tower.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The south front, Bearwood Mansion" vspace   =5 align=left src="images/Bearwood/College/South%20Front%20with%20Tower_BW_TN.jpg" width=276 height=207 ></a>t passed away. The house stands on an éminence. A 
        broad terrace surrounds it on two sides, and on the south are stone 
        steps leading to the paths running down to the lakes. In the distance 
        are beautiful woods of beech and fir and oak, where, in the peaceful 
        seclusion of the park, wild nature can be studied under perfect 
        conditions. Mr. Walter also bestowed much care upon the housing of his 
        labourers, rebuilding the cottages in the village of Sindlesham, 
        converting it into a model village. He also constructed a large walled 
        garden with immense conservatories, two Home Farms, a house for his 
        agent, the Walter Arms, making the estate as perfect as his skill and 
        taste for building and his great wealth could devise.</i></p>
        <p><i>Far and wide he extended his domain. He purchased in 1874 from the 
        executors of <b>Mrs. Clive </b>the village of Barkham, about 1,300 acres, and 
        the east coast manor of <b>Finchampstead</b> in 1849 from <b>Sir John Gordon 
        Sinclair </b>for the sum of £30,000. Part of the town of <b>Wokingham</b> and of 
        the village of <b>Sandhurst</b> were also added to the estate, and everywhere 
        are to be seen houses, rectories, farms, and cottages built by Mr. 
        Walter, and also the noble church of <b>St. Paul, Wokingham</b>, of which the
        <b>Rev. H. M. Walter</b> is rector. <a href="images/Bearwood/College/Garden%20Cottages.jpg">

        <p><i><b>Mr.Arthur Fraser Walter</b> came into possession of the estate in 
        1894, and inherited a taste for "bricks and mortar" from his father, and 
        set a high standard of building for farms and <b>workmen’s cottages on the 
        estate</b>, which will now pass to his son, the <b>fifth John Walter</b>, 
        and there is a <b>sixth</b> of that name, an infant, who may in course 
        of time inherit the estate.</i></p>
