<font size="2">
<p align="center" class="sthead"><b><font size="4">DEATH OF MR. WALTER, OF 
BEARWOOD. </font></b></p>
<p>We record with profound regret the death , after a very bad illness, of <b>
Mr. John Walter, J.P., D.L.</b>, the principal proprietor of <i>The Times</i>, 
which melancholy event took place on Saturday last, at his residence, Bearwood, 
Wokingham. Mr. Walter had been in fairly good health, and no serious symptoms 
manifested themselves until the 24<sup>th</sup> ult., when – while at his town 
residence – what was thought to be a rash appeared. His physician, Dr. Venning, 
was immediately sent for, and at once diagnosing the disease, ordered the 
patient’s removal to bed at Bearwood. The complaint – purpera haemorrhagica – 
ran its fatal course, in spite of the skilled and incessant attention of Dr. 
Venning and Mr. Barford of Wokingham, and Mr. Walter succumbed to blood 
poisoning, which is the final stage of the disease, about one o’clock on 
Saturday, Mrs. Walter and other members of the family being present. Deep is the 
sympathy expressed on all sides with Mrs. Walter and the family in their 
irreparable loss. </p>
<p>Mr. Walter (who only last month completed his 76<sup>th</sup> year) held many 
important offices, which he discharged with singular fidelity and 
fair-mindedness, his one aim and object, throughout his long public career, 
being the welfare of his country, and of his native county. He was a man of 
sterling worth, whose religion was shown in his consistent daily life, a staunch 
Churchman, a sound and shrewd politician, a ripe classical scholar, a deep 
student of history, ancient and contemporary, - and, perhaps above all, a 
perfect model of the true English gentleman. Although he wore a somewhat austere 
expression, he was kind and considerate, and unostentatious in every relation of 
life, and amid his multifarious occupations, he ever found time to consider the 
affairs of the poorest of his servants and neighbours, who asked his advice or 
claimed his sympathy, and his wide-spread private benevolence will be sorely 
missed. </p>
<p>County life always had a great and special charm for him, and he was never 
happier than when engaged in improving his beautiful estate. Arboriculture, 
agriculture, and horticulture, alike claimed his attention, and in his practical 
acquaintance with all he excelled. In the agricultural world Mr. Walter’s Devon 
and Shorthorn herds were for many years noted for the care bestowed on them, and 
high local prizes were awarded to the roots grown on his home farm at the 
principal shows.</p>
<p>Passing on to more important matters – though not perhaps so near and dear to 
the hearts of his neighbours and tenants, who were all valued friends, and who 
are now mourning his loss, Mr. Walter was High Steward of Wokingham, a Governor 
of Wellington College, a Member of Parliament for Berks from 1859 till 1865, and 
again from 1868 till 1885, when he retired; an active member of the Court of 
Quarter Sessions, and from its constitution an Alderman of the Berks County 
Council, and, also from the beginning, a highly valued lay member of the Oxford 
Diocesan Conference. He sat for the Borough of Nottingham from 1847-58. In all 
and several of his many public capacities he "gave of his best". Wherever he 
spoke politically he showed himself a sound and consistent Liberal of the old 
school, an advocate of true and beneficent progress, and a staunch and broad 
minded Englishman. </p>
<p>It may be said without the least fear of contradiction that even in the 
trying times of the famous "Parnell Commission", as in the steps which led up to 
it, Mr. Walter had implicit faith in the cause which he so boldly, and at such 
great stress of physical and financial endurance, championed. He was a weighty 
speaker, always listened to in the House of Commons; and at the Diocesan 
Conferences, and elsewhere, his words were almost law. Although a little 
ponderous at times, he had a finished oratorical style, but his speeches were 
mainly regarded for the high sentiment which inspired his every utterance, and 
the shrewd and original line of thought which he constantly showed on questions 
of importance.</p>
<p>Mr. Walter (the eldest son of Mr. John Walter, of Bearwood, M.P. for 
Berkshire 1832-7), was born on October 8<sup>th</sup> 1818, was educated at Eton 
and Exeter College, Oxford, and graduated B.A., took 2<sup>nd</sup> class in 
classics 1840, and proceeded to M.A., 1843. He was called to the bar at 
Lincoln’s Inn 48 years ago. </p>
<p>The deceased gentleman always had a special affection for the town of 
Wokingham, for Wellington College, and for the Finchampstead district. His 
services on the Council of the great military school have more than once been 
borne testimony to by the Price of Wales, the Commander-in-Chief, and others of 
his co-Governors.</p>
<p>At Wokingham his memory will never fade, among the many memorials of his 
munificent generosity being the building and endowment of the beautiful Church 
and Vicarage of St. Paul’s, and its schools, the building of the new parish 
rooms and offices, with handsome clocktower, standing at the corner of the 
Station-road, &amp;c.</p>
<p>As a husband and a father, Mr. Walter could not be excelled. He was twice 
married, his first wife being <b>Emily Frances</b>, daughter of Major Court, of 
Castlemane, Twyford, and his second (the present Mrs. Walter), <b>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Mrs_Walter.htm">Miss Flora 
Macnabb</a></b>, daughter of Mr. J. M. Macnabb, J.P. The sad death of his eldest son 
(<b>Mr. J. B. Walter</b>) while skating on the lake at Bearwood on Christmas 
Eve, 1870, - two days after his return from "The Grand tour" – was a severe blow 
to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Walter is succeeded by his eldest surviving son, <b>Mr. Arthur Fraser 
Walter, J. P., Major in the 1<sup>st</sup> Vol. Batt. Royal Berkshire Regiment</b>, 
and for several years past the acting partner in <i>The Times</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<i>
<p>The Times</i> of Monday published an able and very 
      lengthy memoir of Mr. Walter of primary interest to journalists, dealing 
      with his life-long connection with the Paper, and his influence in the 
      counsels of the famous journal. Concerning Mr. Walter personally, in his 
      private and home life, the writer remarks: </p>
<p><i>"Mr. Walter’s artistic tastes were not less strongly developed than his 
aptitude for business and public affairs. He was fond of landscape gardening on 
a large scale, as the grounds of Bearwood, first laid out by his father and 
constantly beautified by himself, and the avenue of Wellingtonias, planted near 
Wellington College, abundantly testify. Of that college Mr. Walter was a 
Governor, and he founded there, in honour of the hero whose memory he almost 
worshipped, an annual prize for the best English essay on Wellington’s 
despatches, which he well-nigh knew by heart. </i></p>
<p><i>In 1859 he generously assisted his brother, Sir Edward Walter, who 
survives him, in starting the Corps of Commissionaires. Mr. Walter was a fine 
judge of pictures, a judicious buyer, and a regular visitor to the exhibitions 
and the principal sales. His own gallery, partly collected by his father, is an 
assemblage of masterpieces; and he thoroughly enjoyed discussing its beauties 
with visitors who had studied the Dutch school. The best of these pictures he 
lent, some of them more than once, to the winter exhibition of the Royal 
Academy. </i></p>
<p><i>He was a life member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, and had 
been since 1879 a vice-president of the Smithfield Club, of which, in 1882, he 
was president". </i></p>
<p>In closing the memoir <i>"of a good man and a life well spent in the faithful 
discharge of great public responsibilities"</i>, the writer says: </p>
<p><i>"For good or for evil, Mr. Walter’s influence on the history of his time 
has been powerful. His record is that of a conscientious servant of the public, 
a sagacious man of affairs, a faithful steward of his talents and opportunities, 
a devout Christian, a sincere patriot, a high-minded English gentleman."</i></p>
<p>The death of Mr. Walter, of Bearwood, has cast a sad gloom over the entire 
parish of Finchampstead, where "the Squire", as he was generally called, was a 
large employer of labour, and much beloved by the people. Mr. Walter built the 
school-house and schools, kept them in order, and contributed annually in the 
most liberal manner to their support. In the absence of the Rector through 
indisposition, the Rev. P. H. Ditchfield, Rector of Barkham, officiated at the 
Parish Church of Finchampstead on Sunday evening, and made a very touching 
reference to Mr. Walter’s death, as may be seen from an extract of his sermon 
given below. Muffled peals were rung after morning service and again in the 
evening.</p>
<p align="center"><b>----</b></p>
<p>On Sunday last the <b>Rev. P. H. Ditchfield</b>, Rector of Barkham, preached 
in Barkham and Finchampstead Churches on Sunday morning and evening 
respectively, the subject of his discourse being the 1<sup>st</sup> v. of the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
chapter of the Book of Wisdom: "The souls of the righteous are in the hand of 
God". At the close, he said:-</p>
<p><i>We in this place have just lost one who was well known to all here, one 
who will be sorely missed, and who was honoured and respected by all whose 
privilege it was to know him. The squire of this parish, Mr. Walter, has 
suddenly been called to his rest, and wherever one goes, amongst rich people or 
poor people, amongst the educated and the learned, or amongst the humble 
cottagers, one hears nothing but the language of universal lamentation and 
regret on account of his sudden decease. </i></p>
<p><i>A fortnight ago he was reading (as was his wont) the Lessons of Holy 
Scripture in Bearwood Church, and to-day his body rests awaiting the last sad 
scene by the grave-side. It is all very sad, very distressing for those dear 
ones left behind, and your hearts will go out in sympathy for the mourners, for 
his affectionate wife, for his children, who are now pressed down with overmuch 
sorrow. We, too, can sympathise with them; we have lost a true friend, as you 
all know too well. Mr. Walter was a man of large heart and wide sympathies. </i>
</p>
<p><i>You are aware that he always took a keen interest in public affairs, and 
in the conduct of the world’s chief newspaper, which was mainly his property. In 
all the vexed questions of political life amid all the ebbs and flows of popular 
opinion, in all the exciting problems of the day, religious, social, economic, 
as well as political, Mr. Walter ever had deep rooted opinions, which guided the 
conduct of his newspaper and helped to mould and fashion the judgments and 
opinions of the world. And yet amidst all their cares and anxieties which such a 
position entailed, Mr. Walter used invariably to take a personal interest in the 
affairs of the parishes included in his estate. </i></p>
<p><i>As you are aware, he rebuilt at great cost the chancel of Barkham Church, 
and not only that, he took a personal interest in the welfare of the poor who 
laboured for him, and did his utmost to provide good and sanitary dwellings for 
them, performing many acts of pure and personal kindness which will long endear 
his memory. Truly a good and great man has passed away. It is not for me now to 
tell his history or recount his virtues; but at least we may learn this – to 
feel a real sympathy for others in whatever state of life we may be placed. We 
hear much in these days of the severing of class from class, the bitterness 
which is supposed to exist between squires and peasants, and many foolish things 
are said by ignorant demagogues on this subject, I cannot believe that what such 
men say is true. It has not been our experience in this neighbourhood. </i></p>
<p><i>Every one knows that in Mr. Walter they have lost a true friend, and while 
we mourn our loss caused by his death, and sorrow with his family, let us 
endeavour to extend that sympathy to others which he so keenly felt for us, and 
try to imitate the many virtues which his blameless life set forth. He was in 
every sense a religious man. </i></p>
<p><i>Religion was to him a real personal guide and rule of life, and that is 
the secret of all greatness. Be religious men and women, let God direct your 
thoughts and actions, and you, too, will be great, in whatever condition of life 
you may be placed, whether in high estate or lowly born, you, too, will rest, 
when your labours are ended, safe in the hand of God.</i></p>
<p align="center"><b>----</b></p>
<p>At the <b>Wokingham Petty Sessions</b> on Tuesday, before the commencement of 
the business, <b>Sir William Farrer</b>, the presiding magistrate, rose and said 
he wished to call the attention of his brother magistrates to an event which had 
caused them the deepest mourning, viz., the loss they had sustained in the death 
of Mr. Walter of Bearwood, a man of whom he need say but little in this 
neighbourhood; for if ever there was a centre and a man who could do good, that 
centre was this neighbourhood and Mr. Walter the man who applied all the means 
that lay in his power for the good of all around him; and from the beginning to 
the end of his life he devoted his energy, talents, and means to the fulfilment 
of his duty in every relationship of life. Mr. Walter’s memory would live long 
among them, and they would ever mourn his loss. With those few words he wished 
to move that a vote of condolence be sent to Mrs. Walter, Mr. Arthur Walter, and 
family in the loss they had sustained.</p>
<p><b>Mr. H. G. A. Knox</b>, in a few well-chosen words, seconded the 
resolution, remarking that he should say but very little with reference to the 
sad event, because he should probably have an opportunity, at the meeting of the 
Wokingham Board of Guardians next week, of speaking to his brother members on 
the death of Mr. Walter. There was a deep and an extra sorrow on his part in the 
death of their brother magistrate, inasmuch as Mr. Walter was a relation of his 
and had been closely associated with him on the County Council and at his own 
house. He was sure that his death would be a great loss to the county, and in 
his memory would long be remembered and cherished in this and the adjoining 
neighbourhood. </p>
<p>The following resolution of condolence was then unanimously approved:- </p>
<p><i>"That a vote of cordial sympathy be offered by the Wokingham Bench of 
Magistrates to Mrs. Walter, to Mr. Arthur F. Walter, and to the other members of 
the family on the lamented death of Mr. John Walter, the senior Magistrate in 
the Forest Division of Berks, who during the long space of 53 years has acted as 
a Justice of Peace on this Bench. While offering this vote they desire to 
express their deep appreciation of the many great services Mr. Walter has during 
the continuance of a long life steadily rendered, not only to this Bench but to 
the whole neighbourhood."</i></p>
<p>The Clerk (<b>Mr. Frankum</b>) was requested to send a copy of the resolution 
to Mr. Walter’s family.</p>
<p align="center"><b>----</b></p>
<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">THE FUNERAL</font></p>
<p>Took place on Wednesday, and – consistently with the expressed wish of the 
good and revered Squire of Bearwood – was of the plainest possible description, 
all pageantry being dispensed with, and the only signs of mourning as one 
approached the mansion being the solemn tolling of the minute-bell at St. 
Catherine’s, the flag floating at half-mast, and the drawn blinds which made the 
stately house look desolate indeed. As the reporter for <i>The Times</i> said:- 
"Within, the inscription in the ball of the pathetic stanza from Horace – </p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linquenda tellus, et domus, et placens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Uxor: neque harum, quas colis, arborum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Te, praeter invisas cupressos,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ulla brevem dominum sequetur –</i></p>
<p>and that of the more hopeful Christian have we no continuing city, but we 
seek one to find a melancholy significance, and, with the numerous wreaths which 
had come or were arriving from friends, were a forcible reminder of death".</p>
<p>The funeral cortège left the house at noon. A special train of 12 coaches, 
under the charge of Mr. Waddon, the district superintendent, left Waterloo for 
Wokingham at 10.3 a.m., conveying about 140 gentlemen connected with <i>The 
Times</i>, and from many quarters came a numerous company.  </p>
<p>The county of Berks 
was represented by Lord Wantage (the Lord Lieutenant), Sir Anthony Cope (Bramshill), 
Mr. T. C. Garth, M.F.H., the Archdeacon of Berks; the county members, Sir George 
Russell, Mr. W. G. Mount, and Mr. Philip Wroughton; and among those also present 
were Colonel Gray, Mr. J. A. Wiggett, Mr. T. R. Harman, Mr. S. S. Melville, Mr. 
A. A. Weston, Colonel Peat, Sir Arthur D. Hayter, M.P., Mr. R. G. C. Mowbray,

Ackrill, Mr. Marriott, Mr. W. Mundy, Mr. S. Beall, &amp;c. Mr. G. J. Cowburn 
represented the Berkshire Friendly Society, of which Mr. Walter was one of the 
founders and a trustee. Many gentlemen from the neighbourhood were prevented 
from attending on account of the opening of the Assizes at Reading. Mr. Buckle 
(the editor of <i>The Times</i>) and Mr. Leonard Courtney, M.P., were prevented 
from attending by illness. Sir George Dasent, D. W. H. Russell, and Mr. 
Brudenell Carter also expressed their regret at being unable to attend.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sad procession left the mansion at 12 noon, and arrived at St. 
Catherine’s Church exactly at 12.15, the coffin being wheeled by labourers on 
the estate, on a simple bier. This was preceded by the employés on the estate, 
and followed by the Mayor and Corporation of Wokingham, the mourners, the <i>
Times </i>staff, and the tenantry, &amp;c. On approaching the church those preceding 
the coffin opened out, and the procession passed through into the sacred 
edifice, which was filled in every part. The mourners were – Mr. Arthur Fraser 
Walter, Major Frederick Walter, the Rev. Henry Walter (Rector of Bearwood), Mr. 
Francis Walter, Mr. Godfrey Walter, Mr. Hubert Walter, and Mr. Ralph Walter, 
sons; the Rev. F. Barham and Mr. Frederick Heygate, sons-in-law; Mr. John 
Walter, Mr. Robert Walter, Mr. Stephen Walter, and Mr. Elwyn Walter, grandsons; 
Mr. John Henry Walter and Mr. Thomas Charlton, nephews; Mr. James Macnabb and 
Sir Donald Macnabb, brothers-in-law; Mr. Henry Knox, cousin; and Mr. Geoffrey 
Charlton, great nephew. After them came Mr. George Luker and Mr. C. Cowie, old 
servants of Mr. Walter. Sir Edward Walter, Mr. Walter’s brother, was prevented, 
by slight indisposition, from attending. Mr. Deacon, clerk of the works, Mr. 
Tingey (assistant clerk of the works), Mr. Kemp (chief forester), Mr. J. Tegg 
(head gardener), were also among the mourners. </p>
<p>The Mayor (Mr. W. B. Mower) and all the members of the Wokingham Corporation, 
with the Town Clerk (Mr, James May) were preceded by the mace (draped in crape), 
and the Mayor wore his chain of office (which was presented to the late Mayor by 
Mr. Walter, as the result of a subscription to which he largely contributed). 
Mr. Henry Simmons, the steward, was unable to join in the procession, he having, 
as churchwarden, the charge of the seating arrangements, which he carried out 
admirably. </p>
<p>A number of the 
resident gentry and tenants lined the path on each side, and several of the 
under-gardeners on the estate followed the procession, bearing the wreaths which 
could not be placed on the coffin. At the west porch the coffin was met by the 
officiating clergy, the Bishop of Reading (Dr. Randall), the Rev. J. T. Brown, 
vicar of St. Paul’s, Wokingham and rural dean, and the Rev. P.H. Ditchfield, 
rector of Barkham, who preceded it, the Bishop saying the opening sentences of 
the solemn service of the Church, until it was placed on the trestles near the 
chancel.  </p>
<p>The service was absolutely plain, and the only ornament in the church 
was the collection of white flowers on the Holy Table. The Rev. J. T. Brown read 
the lesson, and the hymn, "Peace, perfect peace," (537 A. and M.) was sung with 
great feeling by the crowded congregation. Miss Jeacock, the organist, who had 
played some very appropriate voluntaries during the assembling of the 
congregation, softly rendered Mendelssohn’s beautiful air, "O rest in the Lord," 
as the body was borne out of the sacred building.</p>
<p>The interment took place in a plain earth grave, simply lined with moss, in 
the centre of the space on the south side of the church which was formerly the 
family vault, but which by the wish of the late Mr. Walter was recently filled 
in. In the family vault were interred the mother and father, the first wife, and 
the eldest son of the deceased.</p>
