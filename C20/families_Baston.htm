<p class="stbody"><strong>John Thomas Baston</strong> 
      moved to Arborfield after his discharge from the Army in about 1908. In 
      the 1911 census he was living in a cottage at Arborfield Court with his 
      wife and two children and is described as an Army pensioner (butler).</p>
      <p>John was born at Barnack, near 
      Stamford, Lincolnshire in 1874 to an agricultural labourer, <strong>George 
      Baston</strong>. He joined the Army in 1890, probably lying about his real 
      age, and became a member of the Royal Artillery with the rank of driver 
      and then gunner, both equivalent to private. </p>
      <p>In 1897 he married 
      <strong>Alice Drage</strong> at All Saints Church in Blackheath, London, 
      not far from the Royal Artillery depot at Woolwich. He had two children, 
      <strong>Frank Carvely Baston</strong>, born in Ulveston near Bristol in 
      1898, and <strong>Hilda Baston</strong>, born in 1904 at Woolwich. </p>
      <p>According to his surviving 
      service record, he remained in garrisons and camps around the British 
      Isles until November 1899 when his battery, the 63rd Battery of 
      the Royal Field Artillery embarked to South Africa from Birkenhead on the 
      requisitioned transport <i><strong>SS Ismore</strong></i>. However the 
      ship never made it to port, as en-route she ran on to rocks at Columbine 
      Point, a notorious site of shipwrecks. A lighthouse was somewhat belatedly 
      erected in 1936. The men and most of the equipment were rescued, but many 
      of the guns and the 140 horses on board were not so lucky. </p>
      <p>The battery was taken by the 
      <i><strong>SS Algeria</strong></i> to Natal where they disembarked and 
      were re-equipped. The 63rd battery took part in operations against the 
      Boers in the Transvaal culminating in the relief of Ladysmith. John Baston 
      was transferred to “A” battery (Chestnut troop) of the Royal Horse 
      Artillery, and stayed in South Africa until December 1900 he and the rest 
      of the troop were sent back to England on the <i><strong>SS Hawarden Castle</strong>  </i>. 
      He received the Queen's South Africa medal with six clasps recognising the 
      actions in which his units fought including Cape Colony, Tegula Heights, 
      Orange Free State, Relief of Ladysmith, Transvaal and Laing's Nek. He was 
      also awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in the reign of 
      Edward VII. He returned to South Africa on garrison duties in 1905 until 
      1907 and was finally discharged to the reserve in 1909. </p>
      <p>In the First World War he enrolled as a Special 
      Constable and received the Special Constabulary Long Service medal with 
      clasp for the Great War. In December 1917 he re-enlisted in the army, this 
      time in the Army Service Corps and promoted to acting corporal. He was 
      finally discharged back to the reserve in 1919. This time his address is 
      given as Ashridgewood which is where <strong>Maud Allfrey</strong> (nee 
      <strong>Bruce</strong>      
                 
                  
                   
                   
                   
       ) the daughter of Mrs Bruce of Arborfield Court had a house, so 
      perhaps he moved when Arborfield Court was sold in 1916. </p>
      <p>During the 1920's John Thomas 
      lived in London, probably still as a butler. However during the final 
      years of his life he was the tenant of the “Hare and Hounds” public house 
      in Old Warden Bedfordshire. The pub is still standing and little changed, 
      at least externally, as it was in his day. On December 7th 1927 
      he died and is buried in Old Warden churchyard. His headstone also 
      commemorates the death of his only son, Frank, who was killed in the First 
      World War. </p>
      <p><strong><a 
      href="../WW1/WW1_Private_Baston.htm">Frank Baston</a></strong> 
      was an apprentice with <strong>Goodall and Co.</strong>     
         , plumbers and decorators with a shop on The Butts in 
      Reading. At the age of 18 he joined the 6th Battalion, Royal 
      Berkshire regiment and went to France to fight on the Western Front in 
      August 1916. Although his service record is missing (probably destroyed by 
      bombing in 1940) he would almost certainly fought in the latter stages of 
      Battle of the Somme during September 1916. </p>

      width=609 height=1000></a>     
                    
                    
                    
                 
                  
                  
                   
                  
        </p>
      <p> In February 1917 the 
      battalion saw action in a ill fated attack at Boom Ravine where they met 
      their objectives but had no support and had to withdraw. They were then sent 
      an area south of Arras where they took part in an attack near Wancourt. 
      According to the battalion war diary on May 3rd they moved 
      forward through a heavy German barrage and sustained 15 killed, 23 wounded 
      and 2 missing. The following two days were described as “quiet” but 
      patrols were unable to find any wounded. Shell fire killed at least one 
      officer on 5th May although no other ranks are mentioned in the 
      diary entry. </p>
      <p>It is not known exactly when Frank was killed and 
      his body was never found but officially his date 
      of death was recorded as 5th May 1917, a few days short of his 
      19th birthday. He is commemorated on the Arras Memorial in the Faubourg-d'Amiens cemetery 
      in Arras and on the memorial at Arborfield Cross. His family 
      were presented with a 'death penny' to commemorate his war 
      service. </p>
