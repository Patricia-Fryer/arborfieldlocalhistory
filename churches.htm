<p class="stbody">Arborfield has had one or more church buildings since Saxon 
times. The Saxon wooden church was replaced in the 13th Century by a <b>
<a href="church_old.htm">flint and 
chalk building</a></b> that still exists today as a romantic ruin near the River Loddon. 
It fell into disrepair by 1862, when the decision was made to build a 
replacement building on a site much closer to the main settlement at Arborfield 
Cross. For many years it was hidden by ivy which covered all sides almost 
to ground level - there's evidence that it was ivy-clad back in Edwardian times 
- see <b><a href="Ditchfield_Church_Notes/Notes_on_Church_History.htm">here</a></b> 
for details.</p>

<p class="stbody">By the mid 18th Century, a group of <b>Dissenters</b> had built their own 
<b><a href="churches_dissenters.htm">chapel</a></b> opposite the Bull Inn at Arborfield Cross. According to the history 
published in 1922 by the Women's Institute, in the mid-1800's<span lang="EN-GB">, 
&quot;there was an empty Church and a flourishing Chapel;&nbsp; but in a very short time 
the Chapel was pulled down, as no-one went to it, and those who did not go to 
Church regularly every Sunday could be counted on two hands.&nbsp; The men went in 
the morning and the women afternoon in the winter, evening in the summer&quot;.&nbsp;

<p class="stbody">The replacement St. Bartholomew's Church was consecrated in 
1863, and is faced in flint. Some of the building materials were taken from the 
old church, leaving just the East Wall and the brick-built Conroy Chapel. In the 
1930's the Standen Tomb and other monuments were moved into the new church, 
along with a surviving stained glass window known as &quot;Aaron's Head&quot;, and the 
roof of the old Conroy Chapel was removed.&nbsp; The new church is about half a 
mile from Arborfield Cross along Church Lane, on the site of an old farmstead 
known as '<b><a href="properties_elishas.htm">Elisha's Farm'.</a></b></p>

        <p class="stbody">In the early 1900's there was a <b>Congregational Chapel
        </b>at Arborfield Cross on the site of the <b>British Legion</b> car park. It 
        was later used as a <b>Salvation Army Hall</b>, but was demolished by the mid-century. Click <b>
        <a href="churches_congregational.htm">here</a></b> for more information.</p>

        <p class="stbody">A <b>Mission church</b> met at the Village Hall on Eversley Road for several years 
        until mid-2006. Unlike the old dissenters, it happily 
        co-existed with St. Bartholomew's, and the Rector and former Pastor are close 
        friends.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The <b><a href="C20/families_Ditchfield.htm">Rev. Peter Ditchfield</a></b> was a 
        <b>Rector of 
        Barkham</b> for around 40 years up to his death in 1930. He was connected 
        with Arborfield through the <b>Arborfield, Newland and Barkham C.E. 
        School</b>, and was an historian of national importance, having 
        published over 100 books. His hand-written <b>'Notes on an 
        Archaeological Society field-trip to the Old Church' </b>have survived, 
        and have been transcribed - click <b>
        <a href="Ditchfield_Church_Notes/Notes_on_Church_History.htm">here</a></b> 
        for details.
        </p>

        <p class="stbody">From 1846 onwards, the <b>Liberty of Newland</b> was 
        placed in the new ecclesiastical parish of <b>
        <a href="C19/churches_st_catherine_bearwood.htm">St. Catherine's, 
        Bearwood</a></b>, endowed by the <b>Walter</b> family of <b>Bearwood 
        Mansion</b>. Thus, the official parish church for most residents of <b>
        Arborfield Cross</b> was not <b>St. Bartholomew's</b> in Church Lane, 
        but <b>St. Catherine's</b> in Bearwood, which is over two miles away. 
        The ecclesiastical boundaries weren't re-drawn until the 1980s, and now 
        St. Bartholomew's is now the official parish church for the whole of 
        Arborfield and Newland.
