<p class="stbody"><font size="2"><b>Ellen Anne Hayes</b> was born in 1846 to the 
Rector of Arborfield, <b>Rev. John Warren Hayes</b> and his wife <b>Ellen</b>, 
and was baptised at Arborfield Church on September 14<sup>th</sup> that year. 
Her brother <b>John Beauchamp Hayes</b> was born in 1849, carrying his mother's 
maiden name. Sadly, the children were orphaned when <b>Ellen</b> died in August 
aged only 32, and was buried in the old churchyard on August 23<sup>rd</sup> 
1849, just a week before her son was baptised.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><i>On December 12th 1896, the 'Reading Mercury' reported:</i></p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>DEATH OF MRS JOHN SIMONDS </b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>With widely-spread pain and regret the news was received, on Wednesday, not 
only in the neighbourhood, but throughout a wide circle, of the painfully sudden 
death of <b>Mrs. John Simonds</b>, of <b>Newlands</b>. </p>
<p>The deceased lady had not enjoyed good health for some time, but nothing was 
actually feared by her ordinary medical attendant or by the specialists who were 
called in owing to the baffling nature of the symptoms. She was taken very ill 
in the middle of the night of Tuesday, and expired on the following morning, 
probably from some affection of the heart, so that she did not long survive her 
father, the late <b><a href="families_hayes.htm">Rev. Sir John Warren Hayes, 
Bart</a></b>. </p>
<p>The utmost sympathy is felt among all classes with Mr. John Simonds and his 
five daughters and two sons in their sad and sudden bereavement. Not only will 
society miss a bright ornament, but the poor will lose a kind-hearted and 
sympathetic friend and one who was always doing good. The funeral takes place on 
Monday at Arborfield.</p>
<p><br>

<p align="center"><b>THE LATE MRS. JOHN SIMONDS, OF NEWLANDS</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>The funeral of this much lamented lady, whose death we recorded last week, 
took place on Monday by the side of her father, the <b>Rev. Sir John W. Hayes, 
Bart.</b>, at Arborfield churchyard. </p>
<p>The afternoon was inclement, but nevertheless there was a very large 
gathering of persons of all classes assembled to show their regard for the 
deceased and heartfelt sympathy with Mr. John Simonds and his family. The 
officiating clergy were the <b>Rev. J. Jones</b>, Rector of Arborfield, and the
<b>Rev. A. L. White</b>, Rector of Mortimer West End. </p>
<p>Some 70 carriages joined in the cortège, and the beautiful floral tokens of 
regret were exceedingly numerous. The arrangements were satisfactorily carried 
out by <b>Messrs. Vincent and Sons</b>, of Arborfield.</p>

<p><i>The same issue's <b>'Hunting Notes'</b> reported:</i></p>
<p><b>MR. GARTH’S HOUNDS</b> met at Brick Bridge on the 14<sup>th</sup>, but did 
not hunt owing to the funeral of <b>Mrs. John Simonds</b> (the hon. secretary’s 
wife) being fixed for that day.</p>
