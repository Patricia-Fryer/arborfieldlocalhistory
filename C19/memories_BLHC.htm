The <b><a href="../C20/memories_LHRS.htm">Local History Recording Scheme of the 
mid-20th Century</a> </b>wasn't the first organised attempt to record 
Berkshire's history at a local level. By then, the <b>Victoria County History of 
Berkshire</b> had been published, the last volume being put together by the <b>
<a href="../C20/families_Ditchfield.htm">Rev. P. H. Ditchfield</a></b> (Rector 
of Barkham until his death in 1930) and <b><a href="../C20/families_Cope.htm">J. 
Hautenville Cope</a></b> of Finchampstead, whose wife's maiden name was <b>Emma 
Elizabeth Thoyts</b>.<p>Prior to that, there was a <b>'Berkshire Local History Club'</b>, 
which had a small membership spread around the county and extending to London, 
mostly of clergy or their spouses, or of country house owners or their families. </p>
<p>The Berkshire Local History Club seemed to be based around a distribution list. 
An exercise book was 
forwarded to each member in turn, who added any relevant notes on the subjects 
currently under discussion. As far as Arborfield is concerned, Volume 9, current during 1889-1890, 
covered the <b>'Basildon, Arborfield, Yattendon, etc.'</b> The inside front page 
of this volume listed 
the subscribers in neat hand-writing, with these instructions:<br>

<p>'Arborfield' starts on Page 51 of the lined exercise book. 'P. H. 
Ditchfield' and 'Emma Thoyts' contributed most to the 'Arborfield' pages, and 
Emma's sketches, in colour, were pasted into the left-hand pages which faced 
pages 57 and 59. There were many empty pages for Arborfield, probably because at 
this time, there were no Club members living in Arborfield. However, for other 
villages such as Sulhamstead, there were printed booklets on various subjects. 
Emma Thoyts had published a list of Sulhamstead burials covering the years 1602 
to the mid 1750s, and at the end of this booklet is printed: <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>"I have a full transcription of the Registers of both parishes of Sulhamstead 
until the present century with my own notes added, but owing to the many 
objections raised by the Rector, Revd. A. Shepherd, I have decided only to print 
the above. Though I believe that similar publications increase instead of 
diminishing the search fees, and are of no practical use, except to the 
Antiquary".</b></i></p>

<p>Page 51 starts with two unsigned notes:<br>
<br>
<i><b>In old deeds called Arbor.<br>
<br>

<br>
However, the next note was signed 'P. H. Ditchfield'; as the Rector of Barkham, 
he had a link with Arborfield through the shared Church School, and had a long 
association with the ruins of the old church in Arborfield. He wrote:<br>
<br>
<i><b>In some documents the name appears in the form Eberfield probably from the 
Saxon 'Ofor' and boar, as in 'Eversley', hence it would mean 'the clearing when 
the wild boars abounded'.</b></i></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">[Note added alongside:]</span><i> One 
flagon &amp; two Patens. Only the flagon is old</i></b>. - P.H.D.<br>
<br>
<i><b>The church was built in 1256 about the same year as that of Swallowfield, 
dedicated to S. Bartholomew. Built of chalk &amp; flint, the tower at the W. End 
being carried on 4 wooden posts and containing 5 bells, which were moved to the 
new church, built in 1863. The old chancel was 9 ft. by 24 ft., nave 58 ft by 28 
ft. The two aisles of old Church are still standing having been retained by Sir 
Edward Conroy, &amp; a porch built as an entrance to the aisle in 1863. One of the 
aisles contains tablets to the memory of the Conroy family, &amp; the other being in 
possession of the Hargreaves family contains the Standen Tombs. Some addition 
was made to the church in 1631, as a beam with that date recorded on it was 
found in 1863. <br>
</b></i><br>
[continued on left-hand page 90:] <i><b>The door is ancient, having heavy iron 
'winged' hinges. There are the remains of a piscina, credence table &amp; sedilia. 
The roof of the old Church was taken off in 1863, as it was considered unsafe. 
Some mural paintings were discovered beneath the plaster. In the Hargreaves 
Chapel there is a fine tomb of William Standen, Lord of the Manor of Arborfield, 
who died 1639. Another to Edward Standen, the last heir, who died a bachelor in 
1730, the hero of Gay's poem 'Molly Mogg'.</b></i> - P. H. Ditchfield.</p>
