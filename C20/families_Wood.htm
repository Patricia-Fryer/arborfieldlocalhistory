<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><br></span>The Local History Society is 
pleased to be asked to help with family history enquiries, and in 2013 we were 
asked about the Wood family.<strong><img alt="" height="245" src="../images/new/JamesMcMillanWood1880to1956.jpg" style="float: right" width="323"></strong></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>James (Jimmie) McMillan Wood</strong> 
	  (1880-1956) was a Farm Bailiff/Manager at <strong>Arborfield Hall Farm</strong> 
	  from approximately 1932 to 1951. The farm had been bought by <strong>
	  <a href="families_Allsebrook.htm">Guthrie Allsebrook</a></strong>, whose 
	  main interest seems to have been water supply, and a <strong>
	  <a href="councils_water_supply_1933.htm">water main</a></strong> was built 
	  from the farm through the village to a reservoir at Bearwood in 1933.</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">James, a Scot originally from Paisley in 
	  Renfrewshire, was married to <strong>Annie</strong>, and they 
	  farmed initially with help from son <strong>Donald</strong> and daughter
	  <strong>Annie, known locally as Nancy</strong>. (She was given this name 
	  in the 1940’s by the service personnel when she was the evening Barmaid at
	  <strong><a href="../properties_bull.htm">The Bull</a></strong> for the
	  <strong><a href="families_Edith_Bushell.htm">Bushnell family</a></strong>). 
	  Annie senior came from the delightfully-named Doune Carloway in the Isle 
	  of Lewis; born in 1877, she married James in Glasgow in 1900, and their 
	  daughter Nancy was born in 1919 at <strong>Manor Farm in Finchampstead</strong> 
	  - quite a change of scene.</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Frank Thorpe</strong> was their 
	  Herdsman. They had a housekeeper called <strong>Edith Bridgeland</strong>.</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Annie died at home (in the <strong>Farm 
	  Cottages</strong> accessed at the very bottom of Church Lane) on 16 
	  February 1940. James then re-married in Wokingham in 1941 to <strong>Edith 
	  L Bridgeland</strong>. Edith was originally from Danehill in Sussex, born 
	  in 1888.<img alt="" height="216" src="../images/new/Anne_Wood_Albert_Bateman_1945.jpg" style="float: left" width="156"></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Daughter Nancy married and moved to Reading in 1945; 
	  we found her first Banns of marriage on 27th May, a few weeks after VE 
	  Day: <strong>Anne MacDonald Wood</strong> of St. Bartholomew's Arborfield 
	  was to marry <strong>Albert Noel Bateman</strong> of St Bartholomew's 
	  Reading. The wedding took place at the church on Erleigh Road in Reading 
	  on 16th June 1945. Anne stayed in the locality, dying in Yateley in 1999.</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>James and Edith</strong> retired and 
	  moved to Eversley in 1951 into <strong>Bakers Farm Cottage and Post Office</strong> 
	  in <strong>Eversley Street</strong>. James died in Eversley. <strong>Geoff 
	  Bateman</strong> has found out a little more about Edith:</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Edith’s</strong> death certificate shows that 
	  on Wednesday 12 February 1958 she passed away in Shinfield, two miles from 
	  Arborfield Hall Farm. The house where she died was at 6 Ilbury Close, 
	  Shinfield and at the time occupied by the informant(s) to the death,
	  <strong>Kathleen &amp; Raymond Beasley</strong>. Before her marriage <strong>
	  Kathleen (nee Mullins)</strong> and her family had lived in adjoining 
	  Agricultural Cottages at Arborfield Hall Farm, working as a Tractor Driver 
	  for Geoff's grandfather. Both families become firm friends and when James 
	  died, it seems they invited Edith to live with them and their young 
	  children, one of whom, <strong>Heather Howarth (née Beasley)</strong>, 
	  clearly recalled Edith and how she “occupied” the family front room at 
	  Ilbury Close. Berkshire Burial Index Records show Edith was cremated at 
	  the Henley Road Crematorium in Caversham Reading on the 18 February 1958.</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Nancy's son Geoff wanted to find out whether there 
	  was any other information on the family, or if there were photos of the 
	  farm or its cottages, or if there is any idea where the burial plot was. 
	  Unfortunately, we don't know where the burial was; possibly it was located 
	  where most of the graves were cleared in front of the church, but we do 
	  have some information on where the family lived. </p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">The 1939 Register of Electors listed 'McMillan Wood 
	  and Annie McDonald Wood' at 'Hall Farm', which isn't too specific. Nor is 
	  the 1946 Register, which also shows 'James M Wood and Edith R Wood' at 
	  'Hall Farm'. However, the 1946 register mentions that 'David V Wood and 
	  Peggy Wood' lived at South Lodge, which was on the Reading Road by 
	  Arborfield Bridge. The same details are shown in the 1950 Register.</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Nancy kept an autograph book while she worked at The 
	  Bull. These two pages give some idea of life in the village in wartime:</p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">

	  <p class="MsoNormal">
	  <img alt="" height="500" src="../images/new/NancysAutographBook31942.jpg" width="620"></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Did Nancy know <strong>Ben Smith</strong>, who
	  <strong>played the piano at The Bull</strong> for a time in WWII? He 
	  worked at the <strong><a href="../properties_hall_decoy.htm">'Starfish' 
	  Decoy site</a></strong> at Arborfield Hall Farm, and who married <strong>
	  Elsie Fleming</strong> on 2nd February 1942 - see the article <strong>
	  <a href="memories_pam_slade.htm">'A Wartime Childhood in Brook Cottage'</a></strong>. </p>
