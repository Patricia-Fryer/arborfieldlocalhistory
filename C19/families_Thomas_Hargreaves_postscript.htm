	  From the Hampshore Advertiser, 30th September 1891, came this glowing 
	  tribute:<p CLASS="auto-style2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	  <span class="auto-style1"><strong>BISHOPSTOKE. DEATH OF CAPTAIN 
	  HARGREAVES.</strong></span> </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;The death is announced 
	  as having occurred in London on Monday night of <strong>Captain Thomas 
	  Hargreaves, of The Mount, Bishopstoke</strong>, and somewhat unexpectedly, 
	  although he had been ailing for some time past. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Captain Hargreaves will be 
	  much missed in this district, as he was a warm supporter of the various 
	  institutions connected with it, and the charming grounds attached to the 
	  Mount were always available for use for the benefit of any good cause. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The deceased was well known 
	  in yachting circles, being the <strong>owner of the Ianira, ss, and a member of 
	  the following clubs:-</strong></p>
	  <p>Club Nautique de Nice,<br>
	  Royal Cinque Ports,<br>
	  Royal Harwich, <br>
	  Royal Dart,<br>
	  Isle of Wight,<br>
	  New Thames,<br>
	  Royal Thames,<br>
	  Royal Yacht Club Italiano,<br>
	  Royal Southampton,<br>
	  Royal Torquay and<br>
	  Royal Victoria.<br>
	  </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is but a short time since 
	  that the <strong>Ianira</strong> left Hythe (Southampton Water) for 
	  <strong>Ramsgate</strong>. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Captain 
	  Hargreaves was a very generous support of the local regattas, and his 
	  death will cause a gap not easily filled. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">His demise is much regretted at 
	  Bishopstoke, and also at Eastleigh, and the absence of his four-in-hand 
	  and coach at Southampton will be much missed. </p>

	  obituaries appeared in newspapers throughout England, including this 
	  article from the <strong>Manchester Courier and Lancashire General 
	  Advertiser</strong> of 1st October 1891. Others mentioned that he died at 
	  the British Hotel in Jermyn Street.<br><br>Strangely, nothing was 
	  mentioned of his death in any of the Berkhsire newspapers. Their readers 
	  would have needed to buy the <br>Portsmouth Evening News of Friday 2nd 
	  October to find out about the funeral:<br><br><strong><em>&quot;The funeral of

	  its <strong>'Society Gossip'</strong> column on 20th February 1892, the
	  <strong>Hampshire Advertiser</strong> announced the forthcoming sale of 
	  The Mount estate and its contents in late March. <br><br>The house failed to sell at the Auction held 
	  on 28th March 1892, but the contents 
	  sold very well indeed, as reported here:
	  <a href="properties_The_Mount_Bishopstoke.htm#SaleContents">
	  <strong>Sale of contents</strong></a>.<br><br>When the Will was published, 
	  it was revealed that Thomas had two sons, John Reginald Hargreaves and Cecil 
	  Montague, who shared most of the bequest. Thomas made generous provision for his staff - perhaps too generous 
	  in one case:<p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>
	  Hampshire Advertiser 05 Nov 1892: SUICIDAL AND ALCOHOLIC. </strong></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;<strong>Frank Collins</strong> 
	  was charged with an attempt to poison himself with Battle's vermin powder. 
	  - It appeared that prisoner had had some money as a legacy under <strong>
	  Captain Hargreaves' will</strong>, and had consumed it alcoholically, and 
	  got an idea that everybody was against him, and that he was a ------- 
	  fool. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He went, on October 27, to 
	  the Foresters' Arms, Stoke Common, where Rose Lock supplied him with tea 
	  and bread and butter. In a few minutes she heard a noise, and found 
	  Collins lying on the floor, and with the poison in his hands, and he said 
	  he had done for himself. - Police-constable Snell and Dr. Hegan were sent 
	  for, emetic administered to the extrusion of the poison, and Collins soon 
	  recovered, and admitted he was a fool. - Committed to the Assizes and 
	  repentance meanwhile.</p>

	  <br>Another former employee also died in 1892:<p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	  Hampshire Advertiser, 27th August 1892: EASTLEIGH -OBITUARY.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;The funeral of the 
	  late <strong>Mr. Robbins</strong>, caretaker of the railway Institute, 
	  Eastleigh, took place on Tuesday. Deceased was only 44 years of age, 
	  twenty years of which he spent in the service of Captain Hargreaves. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the captain died Mr. 
	  Robbins's services were no longer required, and he was subsequently 
	  appointed to the post at the Institute, which he held at the time of his 
	  death. The body was taken from the Institute at two o'clock, and conveyed 
	  in a hearse to the Bishopstoke new churchyard. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Some of the deceased's 
	  fellow servants, when in the employ of the late Captain Hargreaves, 
	  attended the funeral, as did also some members of the Institute committee. 
	  The Rev. --- Pennington, curate, at Eastleigh, conducted the service at 
	  the Church. Various tradesmen partly or wholly closed their houses, as the 
	  funeral party left the Institute, the deceased being very generally 
	  respected.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">-----</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In a Death Notice published 
	  in the same newspaper on 3rd September, we get a little more information 
	  about George Robbins: </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><em>&quot;On the 19</em></strong><sup><strong><em>th</em></strong></sup><strong><em> 
	  ult., at Eastleigh, George Robbins, 20 years coachman to the late Captain 
	  Hargreaves, of The Mount, Bishopstoke.&quot;</em></strong></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">According to the 1891 
	  Census, <strong>George Robbins</strong> was born in <strong>Hurst, 
	  Berkshire</strong> and lived as a Coachman at The Stable, The Mount. His 
	  37-year-old wife Mary came from Plaitford in Hampshire. As it happens, in 
	  the 1871 Census there was a <strong>'George Robins'</strong>, a groom aged 
	  23 from Hurst, lodging in Arborfield. Although the Census doesn't specify 
	  his address, it seems that he was lodging on the Arborfield Hall estate; 
	  at the time of this Census, <strong>Sarah Hargreaves</strong> and her 
	  children were away from Arborfield, staying with relatives. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We can trace George to his 
	  baptism in the old St. Bartholomew's Church in Arborfield on 13th February 
	  1848; his parents were William and Elizabeth Robbins of Hurst (which 
	  included the Liberty of Newland). We can also locate the family in the 
	  1851 Census living in 'Bear Lane', Newland, so it's likely that Thomas had 
	  known George Robbins since his childhood. </p>

	  There's another postscript following Captain Hargreaves' death - an unpaid 
	  bill:</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Hampshire Advertiser 
	  30 July 1892:</strong></p>
	  <p class="auto-style3" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>HAMPSHIRE SUMMER 
	  ASSIZES: TILLING V. HARGREAVES.</strong></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Hon. Bernard Coleridge, 
	  M.P. (instructed by Messrs. Pearce and Keele) for plaintiff, and Mr. 
	  Bullen (instructed by Messrs. Allen and Son) for defendants.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Plaintiff is a yacht 
	  chandler</strong> of Southampton, and the defendants <strong>the executors 
	  of the late Capt. Hargreaves, of The Mount, Bishopstoke</strong>. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The claim was for goods sold 
	  and delivered for the defendant's yacht, the <strong>Ianiras</strong> 
	  ([sic]. Mr. Coleridge stated that the defendant had since died, and the 
	  executors were now being sued. The defence was that all had been paid but 
	  £18 1s. 10d., and payment had been made into Court of that sum. There was 
	  due, Mr. Coleridge said, on the 1<sup>st</sup> January, 1888, the sum of 
	  £318 1s 10d., and on the 14<sup>th</sup> April a cheque on account for 
	  £200 was sent by Capt. Hargreaves. Mr. Coleridge went on to explain how 
	  the account between the parties stood at different dates.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In November, 1889, an 
	  interview took place between the parties when the account was gone 
	  through, and defendant admitted that it was accurate. Other transactions 
	  followed, and letters were read to show that certain payments made were 
	  for certain accounts, and Mr. Coleridge said the balance now sued for was 
	  £118 16s. 7d.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Bullen said he confessed 
	  that since these documents had been brought before him he did not for one 
	  moment impugn Mr. Tilling's position. The litigation was unfortunate in 
	  this respect. Captain Hargreaves was a very well-known gentleman and owner 
	  of this yacht. He had a captain who used to procure supplies for him. For 
	  some reason or other he became dissatisfied with his way of doing it. 
	  Captain Hargreaves died on the 28<sup>th</sup> September, 1891, and the 
	  writ was issued against the executors in March, 1892.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Under a letter in January, 
	  1888, Captain Hargreaves gave instructions that instructions were not to 
	  be taken from his captain unless by written or countersigned order from 
	  himself. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mr. Bullen detailed the 
	  proceedings which had already taken place in the case, and said that as 
	  there was evidently some mistake, discovery had to be made. That discovery 
	  was not made until that morning, and it would be seen that up till that 
	  time defendants had been utterly in the dark as to some of the facts. Mr. 
	  Allen and his co-executor were bound to defend the action, but upon Mr. 
	  Tilling going into the box and stating that these things had been supplied 
	  by order, he (Mr. Bullen) would say no more, - After some further 
	  argument, the plaintiff was sworn. Examined by Mr. C. T. Giles, he spoke 
	  to supplying Capt. Hargreaves with goods between 1887 and 1889, according 
	  to the lists before him. The goods shown on account were supplied to 19<sup>th</sup> 
	  September, 1889, and those named on the other list were supplied in 1888.
	  </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Plaintiff was cross-examined 
	  as to the conditions under which the various orders were given. He knew 
	  nothing of the matter after it was put in his lawyer's hands – he knew 
	  nothing of law – Mr. Bullen: What a comfort (laughter). - His Honour 
	  eventually gave judgment for plaintiff for £108 3s,, with costs.</p>
