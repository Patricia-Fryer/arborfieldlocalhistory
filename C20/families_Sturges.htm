      the <strong>Sturges</strong> family lived at <strong>Barkham

      at <strong>Barkham Square</strong>  (seen 
      right).&nbsp;Indeed, <strong>Mr. E. M. Sturges</strong> was honoured by 
      the Garth Hunt for&nbsp;his 'long and valuable services' at a

      had its offices at <strong>Shute End</strong> in Wokingham, although its 
      jurisdiction was outside the borders of the town. He was instrumental in

     ><strong>RE-ELECTED.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>Resolution 
      Asking for Electricity.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Mr. E. M. Sturges entered on his 
      32nd year of office as chairman of the Wokingham Rural District Council on 
      Tuesday, when he was again re-elected to the office. Mr. Sturges was first 
      appointed in May, 1903, and he has been a member of the council for 39 
      years. The re-election of Mr. Sturges was proposed by <strong>Col. C. D. 
      Burnell</strong> and seconded by <strong>Mrs. Jarvis</strong>.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Thanking the members, Mr. Sturges 
      referred to the work of the Council, and he thought their water schemes 
      were going along fairly well, although there had been trouble [There had 
      been a prolonged drought at the beginning of 1934].</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Having regard to the enormous 
      increase in building it would be necessary shortly to consider the 
      question of drainage. What was going to happen he did not know, for the 
      expense of such a scheme were enormous. Meanwhile they were doing their 
      best with the vacuum tanks – they were no longer called <strong>“Lavender 
      Jims”</strong> - they were beautiful, sweet-smelling things.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   They were losing the services of 
      <strong>Mr. C. Aldridge</strong> (Surveyor of Buildings), said Mr. 
      Sturges, and they wished him many happy years in his retirement. Anyone 
      who visited their district could not help being struck by their 
      picturesque council cottages, and credit for this was due to Mr. 
      Aldridge.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   In conclusion, he welcomed the new 
      member, <strong>Mr. F. W. Byles</strong>.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>THE 
      VICE-CHAIRMAN.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Mr. George Ford</strong> 
      was unanimously re-elected vice-chairman on the proposition of <strong>Mr. 
      J. Hautenville Cope</strong>, and Mr. Sturges observed that he had held 
      this office for 12 years.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Mr. Ford referred to the enormous 
      increase in receipts from Road Fund licences, and said he felt that they 
      were not having a fair deal from the Government in this matter. He had 
      asked the representative to the County Councils' Association to take the 
      matter up and urge that they might receive more from the fund. The grant 
      to Berkshire had been decreased by some £3,000, and while the County 
      Council paid out the additional money the R.D.C.s had to find it. If they 
      had a larger share from the money received for Road Fund licences it would 
      help their local rates considerably.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Mr. Sturges referred to the 
      question of the <strong>Kingsmere</strong> property, and said that 
      whatever happened, they had agreed they would not entertain the purchase 
      of the lake [In Spring 1934, the lake was totally dry, as shown in a 
      photograph in the 'Mercury' on June 16th].</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Upon the proposition of Mr. Ford, 
      seconded by the chairman, the council passed a resolution expressing the 
      hope that facilities for obtaining <strong>electric power</strong> in the 
      district would be provided as soon as possible, as it was urgently needed. 
      They also referred to the need for cheaper electricity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>HIS PUBLIC 
      LIFE.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>Over 30 Years 
      Chairman of Wokingham R.D.C.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   We deeply regret to record the 
      death of <strong>Mr. Edward Murray Sturges</strong>, which occurred on 
      Tuesday at his home, Barkham Square, Barkham, at the age of 74. Although 
      Mr. Sturges had not been in the best of health of late, his passing came 
      somewhat as a shock to his countless friends, for he was only taken ill on 
      Friday last week. Mr. Sturges was one of the most popular men in East 
      Berks, and he was particularly well known amongst members of the farming 
      community.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   His jovial personality gained him 
      friends wherever he went, but at the same time he was never afraid to 
      express his opinion, and his services were therefore of particular value 
      in the public work in which he played so great a part. In all matters he 
      was fair and just, and his death has left a gap which it will be hard to 
      fill.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   The eldest son of the late 
      <strong>Canon Sturges, Rector of Wokingham</strong>, Mr. Sturges was 
      educated at Winchester and Pembroke College, Cambridge, being captain of 
      the football and cricket teams at the latter. After taking his degree he 
      went, in 1883, to Australia as A.D.C. to <strong>Sir Henry Loch</strong>, 
      afterwards Lord Loch, who was then <strong>Governor of 
      Victoria</strong>    
          
                 
                
                   
                   
        .</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   On his return to England, he 
      studied and qualified as a barrister-at-law at the Inner Temple, but he 
      never practised. From 1891-96 he lived at <strong>Stanlake Park</strong>, 
      and then he moved to <strong>The Coppice, Lower Earley</strong>. In 1904 
      he moved to <strong>Barkham Square</strong> as tenant farmer to <strong><a 
      href="families_arthur_walter.htm">Mr. Arthur Walter</a></strong>    
         
                  
                   
                    
          , and later he purchased the house and 
farm.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>NEARLY 40 
      YEARS ON R.D.C.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Ever since its formation 39 years 
      ago, Mr. Sturges has been a member of the <strong>Wokingham Rural District 
      Council</strong>    
         
                  
      , on which he had rendered invaluable service. A few months after 
      its formation he was elected vice-chairman, and he acted in this capacity 
      until, eight years later, he was elected chairman. This office was held up 
      to the time of his death – a period of 31 years – a record which it would 
      be difficult to better.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   His chief interests in connection 
      with local government were the questions of water supplies and drainage, 
      and the inhabitants on the R.D.C.'s area have much to thank him for in 
      these matters. He was always anxious that wherever possible people should 
      be provided with a plentiful supply of pure water, and that there should 
      be drainage facilities.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   A scheme for supplying water to 
      <strong>Wargrave and Twyford</strong> was put into operation between 1895 
      and 1899, followed by the <strong>Wargrave drainage scheme</strong>. Water 
      supplies for <strong>Sonning and Shinfield</strong> and vast improvements 
      to the old systems were carried through under his guidance as well as 
      dealing with problems concerning drainage. It was only last year that he 
      opened a <strong><a href="councils_water_supply_1933.htm">new pumping 
      station at Arborfield</a></strong>    
         
                 
                 
                 
                 
                    
      and saw another of his ambitions fulfilled.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   By virtue of his office as 
      chairman of the R.D.C., Mr. Sturges was a <strong>Justice of the Peace for 
      the Wokingham Petty Sessional Division</strong>    
         
                    
         , a work for which he was particularly 
      fitted. On the Bench Mr. Sturges displayed the same fairness as he did in 
      presiding over the meetings of the various bodies with which he was 
      connected.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   He was also a keen worker on the 
      now defunct <strong>Wokingham Board of Guardians</strong>    
           
           , having been appointed a member 
      of this body in 1895, and being elected vice-chairman the same year. Ten 
      years later he became chairman, and he remained in this office until the 
      Board was disbanded in 1930.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>SECRETARY OF 
      GARTH HUNT.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   In 1902 Mr. Sturges became 
      assistant secretary of the Garth Hunt, and two years later he arranged the 
      first point-to-point race meeting, which has become one of the most 
      popular events of its kind in the district. From 1910 to 1922 he was 
      secretary of the Hunt, having succeeded the late <strong>Mr. John 
      Simonds</strong>. When he retired the members presented him with a 
      portrait of himself in hunting dress, painted by <strong>Mr. Cecil 
      Aldin</strong>    
        
                   
                 
                    
                   
                  
           .</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   At the time of his death Mr. 
      Sturges was president of the <strong>Garth Hunt Club</strong>    
          
             , and when he had to give up 
      riding to hounds he followed them in his motor-car. In this manner he 
      attended a number of meets during the past season.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   The growth of the 
      <strong>Wokingham Agricultral Association</strong>    
        
        was due in great measure to Mr. Sturges' efforts, 
      for, for a great many years he acted as hon. secretary. Later he became 
      chairman and a vice-president. It was a coincidence that last year this 
      Association's show, with which Mr. Sturges was so closely identified for 
      over 40 years, was held on the day that he was celebrating his 
      birthday.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   When the <strong>Royal 
      Show</strong> came to Reading in July, 1926, he was a member of the 
      executive and local committees, while in 1930 he was on the council of the 
      <strong>Royal Counties Agricultural Association</strong>    
         
                   
                   
        on the occasion of its visit to the town.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Mr. Sturges was also associated 
      with a number of other organisations, including the <strong>Berkshire 
      County Cricket Club</strong> and the <strong>Newlands, Arborfield and 
      Barkham branch</strong> of the <strong>British Legion</strong>    
        
                
                 
       , of which he was president.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   In 1887 Mr. Sturges married 
      <strong>Eliza</strong>, daughter of <strong>Mr. and Mrs. R. Grice, of 
      Australia</strong>, who survives him. His elder son, <strong>Mr. E. E. 
      Sturges</strong>, was killed during the Great War while serving with the 
      King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry. His surviving son is <strong>Major R. 
      G. Sturges</strong>, of the Royal Marines, now stationed at deal, and his 
      twin sister is the wife of <strong>Mr. John Simonds</strong>, of Newlands, 
      Arborfield. Mr. Sturges' brother is <strong>Judge Sturges, K.C.</strong>    
         
                   
                   
                  
                    
                   
           , who is Recorder of Windsor.</p>

   The funeral of Mr. E. M. Sturges, 
      J.P., of Barkham Square, chairman of the Wokingham Rural District Council, 
      whose death at the age of 74, was reported last week, took place at 
      Barkham Church on Saturday amidst every sign of respect. The little church 
      was crowded, and many were unable to gain admission, having to stand in 
      the churchyard throughout the service. The Rev. J. B. Barker (Rector of 
      Stratfieldsaye) officiated, assisted by the rector (the Rev. G. Gregory). 
      Mr. A. E. Manning was at the organ, and the choir were in attendance. The 
      hymn, “Fight the good fight”, was sung in church, and Psalm 23 was 
      chanted, while “Abide with me” was sung at the grave-side. The coffin was 
      taken into church during the morning, and laid at the end of the 
      chancel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong><font 
      size=4>TRIBUTES TO MR. STURGES.</font></strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>From 
      Magistrates and R.D.C.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   On Tuesday reference to the death 
      of Mr. E. M. Sturges were made at the Wokingham County Bench, of which he 
      was a member, and the meeting of the Wokingham Rural District Council, of 
      which he was chairman.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   At the Bench the chairman (Colonel 
      F. G. Barker) said Mr. Sturges was an ex-officio member of the Bench as a 
      result of his being chairman of the Wokingham R.D.C. At the time of his 
      death he had been a member of the Bench longer than any of them present, 
      and he was about the last magistrate who had sat at the Town Hall before 
      that court was built. For the last few years he had been unable to attend 
      very regularly owing to ill-health and the fact that the R.D.C. met on the 
      same day as the Bench. He was well up in all matters connected with the 
      county and country life of the district, with which so many of the cases 
      were connected. The Bench would like to record their appreciation of the 
      work he has done, and their regret at his passing.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>Tributes at 
      R.D.C.</strong></p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   At the council meeting Mr. G. Ford 
      (vice-chairman), who presided, referred to the loss the council had 
      sustained. Remarking that Mr. Sturges' interest in the welfare of the 
      countryside was second to none, Mr. Ford spoke of the late chairman's 
      valued services in the affairs of the council, of which he was a member 
      for 39 years and chairman 31 years. “His was a distinctive personality”, 
      the vice-chairman proceeded. “Now the bowl is broken and there is no other 
      like him to follow on. Courageous in expressing his opinions, he was 
      scrupulously fair, a man of strong will and determination. To the poor he 
      was ever kind-hearted. He served the council with noted ability. He might 
      have used those talents with which he was endowed for his own advancement 
      – he was a qualified barrister and he might have gone on to be a judge – 
      but he preferred to use them for the benefit of his neighbours, without 
      fee or reward. To those of us who knew him more intimately, we mourn his 
      loss not only as an able chairman of this council, but as a friend.”</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Dr. Paterson, on behalf of the 
      officers, said they would like to be associated with Mr. Ford's tribute to 
      their late chairman. They honoured his memory as a gentleman and a 
      chairman.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Mr. F. W. Headington said he had 
      been associated with Mr. Sturges both on the council and in sporting 
      matters. It did not what it was he took up, he was always a strong, 
      powerful man, ready to help in every way, particularly when any difficult 
      point arose. “I am sure the countryside will miss him tremendously.” Mr. 
      Headington added, “There cannot be any man in Berkshire who will be missed 
      more than our great and esteemed chairman, Mr. Sturges.”</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   The clerk (Mr. P. H. Phipps) also 
      remarked that the officers were appreciative of the many acts of kindness 
      extended to all of them by their late chairman during his term of 
      office.</p>      

<p class="MsoNormal">    
   Mr. J. St. L. Stallwood, as one of 
      the junior councillors, associated himself with the tributes already paid, 
      and said that when he joined the council he was very much struck by Mr. 
      Sturges' kindliness. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
