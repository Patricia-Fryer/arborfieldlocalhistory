  <p><b>Claude Sparshott</b> became Rector in 1946. The 'Reading Mercury' of 5th 
  October reported that he <i>"was installed and inducted on Wednesday last week. 
  In the evening, he was ‘At Home’ to about 100 parishioners at the Village 
  Hall. Mr Sparshott was ordained in Newfoundland in 1930 and spent 6 years 
  among the Labrador settlements, his ‘parish’ embracing 300 miles of coastline, 
  which had to be traversed by water in summer and dog sleigh in the winter. 
  From 1944 to 1946 he served as a naval chaplain."</i></p>

        <b>Geoffrey Carr</b> was born in 1909, married Elizabeth (Betty) in 1931 
        and had two sons, Peter and David, and a daughter, Merylin. He was born 
        in the village of Walderton, West Sussex, and went to Monkton Combe 
        School, near Bath. After studying at Christ College, Cambridge, he 
        taught at St. Faith's School, Cambridge.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Geoffrey trained for the Ministry at Ridley Hall, and served as a Curate 
        at St. Luke's Hampstead, then for 6 months at Holy Trinity, Corfu. After 
        a spell as Curate at Christ Church, Southport, he became Vicar of St. 
        Thomas, Stafford, then Vicar, All Saints, Wellington and Eyton, 
        Shropshire.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        After some time as Rector at St. Andrews, Bradfield, Berks, he became 
        Rector, St. Bartholomew's, Arborfield, and can be seen in the <b>
        <a href="church_new_100_centreright.htm">photo</a></b> of the Centenary 
        Celebrations of the 'new' St. Bartholomew's building in 1963. He retired to Guildford, Surrey, and died in 1999 
        aged 89.&nbsp; In 1976, he recorded his <b><a href="memories_carr.htm">
        memories</a></b> of parish life.</p>

        <b>Ian Bull</b> spent some time as a chaplain at Arborfield Garrison, 
        and became the first Rector of the combined benefice of Arborfield and 
        Barkham, starting in 1977, moving into Arborfield Rectory with his wife 
        Joan and their daughter Georgina; their sons had already grown up. The 
        congregation at Barkham had dwindled to single figures by the 
        mid-1970's, but in a few months, it had grown strongly, and now the 
        church is regularly full. </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Ian moved to be the Vicar of Bangkok, but sadly developed a brain tumour 
        and returned to the U.K. for diagnosis and treatment. He died aged only 
        50, and is buried at Barkham.</p>

        <b>Bob Bawtree</b> and his wife Lois spent a decade at Arborfield with 
        their growing family, encouraging many people to explore their calling 
        and to work with organisations such as Youth With a Mission ('YWAM'). By 
        this time, the congregations could count on many 'home-grown' Readers 
        and others capable of preaching powerful sermons. Bob eventually moved 
        on to become Vicar of Hildenborough in Kent, where he was also Rural 
        Dean of Tonbridge and Honorary Canon of Rochester Cathedral. </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        He is now <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">retired</span>

        <b>David Rowe</b> and his American wife Pixie moved to Arborfield from 
        Basingstoke, bringing with them a passion for evangelism and introducing 
        many new skills to the congregation, such as story-boarding and acting 
        sketches. David encouraged acting in the local Junior School, and many 
        will remember the 'Train' sketch 'London to York', which is an update of 
        the Good Samaritan, and 'David and Goliath', which was once hilariously 
        enacted at the Holiday Bible Club with son Caleb in the role of David. 
        He used the 'Story-board' technique to good advantage at the <b>
        <a href="memories_centenary_Sunday.htm">Parish Council Centenary 
        Celebrations in 1994</a></b>.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Pixie is herself trained as a Reader. David was Rector of Wilford 
        Church in 
        Nottingham for some years - see their web-site <b><a href="http://wilford.org/church/">
        here</a></b>. Before Basingstoke, he was a curate at Moor Lane, <b>
        <a href="http://www.moorlanechurch.co.uk/aboutus-wherearetheynow.html">
        Cranham</a></b>, Essex. David became Warden of <b>
        <a href="http://www.leeabbey.org.uk/">Lee Abbey</a></b> in Devon in 
        October 2008.</p>

        <b>Piers Bickersteth</b> is the son of a Bishop, but worked in commerce 
        for some time before he felt called to train for the ministry. His 
        strength is in teaching, and before 1998 he worked full-time for the 
        <b><a href="http://www.proctrust.org.uk">Proclamation Trust</a></b> where he trained 
        <b><a href="images/Nov14/John_Ikin_and_Piers_Bickersteth.jpg">Jon Ikin</a></b>, who
