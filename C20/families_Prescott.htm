<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><b>Mr. and Mrs. Prescott</b> bought 
Arborfield Court in 1916, but Mr. Prescott was only able to enjoy it for a few 
years, as the following report in the Reading Mercury of </span>December 9th 
1922 shows: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="3">DEATH OF MR K L C PRESCOTT</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="3">A LOSS TO BERKSHIRE</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font size="3">Descendent of Cromwell.</font></b></p>

<p><b>Mr Kenneth Loder Cromwell Prescott</b>, of Arborfield Court, Berkshire, 
who died on Sunday, aged 47, was lineally descended from <b>Oliver Cromwell</b>. 
The last descendent of the Protector in the male line, Oliver Cromwell of 
Theobalds, died in 1821. His only daughter, <b>Elizabeth Oliveria</b>, married
<b>Mr T A Russell </b>of Thruxtons Court, Herefordshire, and her daughter <b>
Elizabeth</b> married Mr Prescott’s grandfather.</p>
<p>Mr Prescott was born in 1873, son of the late <b>Charles Andrew Prescott</b>. 
He was an M.A. of Trinity College, Cambridge. He entered the bank (founded by 
his family in 1766), and on the retirement of his father from the chairmanship, 
became a director in 1902. Prescott’s Bank, Ltd., eventually amalgamated with 
the Union of London and Smith’s Bank, Ltd., from the board of which he retired 
during the war.</p>
<p>As deputy chairman of Eley Bros., Ltd., and chairman of the Schultze 
Gunpowder Co. Ltd., he became a director of Nobel Industries, Ltd. He was also a 
director of the Atlas Assurance Co. Ltd., with which his family have been 
connected since its foundation in 1808. </p>
<p>For many years he was on the board of management and treasurer of the East 
London Hospital for Children, and was a member of the General Council of the 
King Edward’s Hospital Fund. </p>
<p>He married in 1911 <b>Elizabeth Marton</b>, daughter of <b>Sir John Shelley, 
Bart.</b>, Skobrooke Park, Crediton, Devon. </p>
<p>He was chairman of the Parish Meeting, vice chairman of the Parochial Church 
Council, and churchwarden of the parish of Arborfield, and a J.P. for Berkshire. 
He leaves three daughters.</p>
<p>Mr Prescott came to reside at Arborfield Court from Basingstoke six years 
ago. Keenly interested in sport, he became the president of the Arborfield 
Football Club, and was an enthusiastic supporter of the local cricket club. He 
was also interested in horticulture and spent much of his leisure time in the 
gardens at Arborfield Court.</p>

<p>Having been for many years connected with hospitals in London, he took a 
prominent part in the local organisation of the <b>Royal Berkshire Hospital 
contributory scheme</b>, and presided at the inaugural meeting held recently. He 
was a manager of the Newland, Arborfield and Barkham Schools, and a member of 
the Standing Committee of the Ruri-decanal Conference.</p>
<p>Mr Prescott had been unwell for about three weeks prior to his death, but was 
improving when a sudden relapse occurred. The news of his death was received 
with general regret in Berkshire, and by it residents of Arborfield have lost a 
valued and esteemed friend.</p>
<p>The funeral of Mr Prescott took place on Thursday at Arborfield, the Rev. J. 
A. Anderson conducting the service. [The article contained a long list of 
mourners].</p>
<p>The interment was alongside the grave of the deceased’s infant son, the grave 
being lined with ivy. At the request of the deceased there were no wreaths, with 
the exception of one of his favourite flowers. </p>
<p>The funeral arrangements were carried out by <b>Messrs. Garrett Bros.</b>, of 
Arborfield.</p>

<p align="left">In a separate article in the same edition, the 'Reading Mercury' 
noted:</p>
<p align="center"><i>"Before the commencement of the ordinary business of the 
Wokingham County Bench on Tuesday afternoon, the chairman (<b>Mr G. A. Watson</b>) 
referred to the death of Mr Prescott.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>"He regretted, he said, to have to announce the death of 
one of the most respected members of the Bench, who had died somewhat suddenly 
on Sunday after a short illness. His death was a grievous loss to the Bench; he 
was a good magistrate and a pleasant friend and neighbour; he would ask the 
Clerk to convey to Mrs Prescott the deep sympathy of the Bench."</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The on-line Census now makes it easy to trace the early 
life of <b>Kenneth Prescott</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1861, his grandfather <b>Frederick Prescott</b>, an 
examiner of Army Accounts, lived comfortably at Oxford Square in Paddington with 
his wife <b>Elizabeth</b> (who is mentioned in the Obituary above). <b>Charles 
Andrew Prescott</b> and several brothers and sisters lived in the family home 
despite having grown up long ago. Charles was 32, and was described as a 'Banker 
and Barrister'. In 1864, he married <b>Emma Catherine Harrison</b>, of 
Blackheath, and by 1871 they were living nearby at Westbourne Crescent in 
Paddington. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kenneth Prescott</b> was 5 years old in 1881, when the 
family and their servants lived at 20 Cambridge Square, also in Paddington. Ten 
years later, he and his 18-year-old sister <b>Oliveria Cromwell Prescott</b> 
boarded at Eye Vicarage in Herefordshire with the <b>Rev. Wilfred Buckler</b>, 
and on Census Day, <b>Charles Prescott</b>, <b>Banker</b>, was a visitor along 
with <b>Emma</b>.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By 1901, Kenneth Prescott, by now a Banker but as yet 
unmarried, was living with his parents at 20 Cambridge Square.</p>
