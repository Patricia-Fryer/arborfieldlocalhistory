<p align="center"><b><font size="3">ARBORFIELD : DEATH OF MRS. EDITH BUSHELL</font></b></p>
<p>It is with deep regret that we have to announce the death of <b>Mrs. Edith Bushell</b>, the much-respected landlady of the Bull Inn, Arborfield Cross, which 
took place on Wednesday last week at a nursing home in Reading, at the age of 58 
years. Her genial manner to everyone with whom she came in contact, endeared her 
to all, and her loss will be greatly felt in the district, as was shown by the 
large congregation at the funeral, which took place on Saturday at Arborfield 
churchyard. </p>
<p>The body was met at the entrance to the church by the vicar, the Rev. J. A. 
Anderson, who conducted the funeral service. Mr. Allen, of Reading, rendered the 
"Dead March" from "Saul". </p>
<p>The mourners were: Mr. Bushell (husband), Miss Lily Bushell (daughter), Mr. 
and Mrs. Duffield (daughter and son-in-law), Mr. and Mrs. M. Bushell (son and 
daughter-in-law), Mrs. Jones (sister), Miss Priest (sister), Mr. and Mrs. Peck 
(sister and brother-in-law), Mr. C. Priest (brother), Mr. and Mrs. Painting, and 
Mr. W. Hall.  </p>
<p>Wreaths were sent from the husband, children, "Peggy and Harold", 
Mr. and Mrs. Vere Allfrey, Miss Mullins, Mr. and Mrs. Bryant, "Annie Cordery", 
Mr. and Mrs. Prior, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson, Miss Elsie Love, "Doll and Will", Mr. 
and Mrs. Russ, "Staff at Arborfield Hall", "Three School Children", "Little 
Betty Neale", Mr. and Mrs. Denton, Mrs. Bishop and family, "Ethel, Marjorie and 
Ivy Prior", Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Neale, Mr. and Mrs. Seymour and family, "Mr. and 
Mrs. Painting and Gladys", Mr. and Mrs. Bartholomew, Mr. and Mrs. Peck and Mrs. 
Priest, Mr. and Mrs. Archie Lousley, Mr. and Mrs. C. Lewis, Mr. and Mrs. 
Gutteridge, "Mr. and Mrs. Priest and Fred", Miss Lunn, Mr. and Mrs. G. Bushell, 
Mr. and Mrs. Rivers, Mrs. Bentley and family, Mr. J. and the Misses Simonds (Newlands), 
and others.  </p>
<p>The funeral arrangements entrusted to and satisfactorily carried out 
by Mr. C. Lovegrove, of Friar Street, Reading.</p>
<p>[It is interesting that the Garrett family were not mentioned, even though they lived opposite. 
The Garretts usually acted as undertakers for the village]</p>
