<p align="center"><b><font size="3">DEATH OF MR J H ROWE – A Well-Known Farmer.</font></b></p>
<p>We regret to record the death of <b>Mr James Hellier Rowe</b>, which occurred 
at Targett’s Farm<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="James Hellier Rowe, sporting a magnificent beard" vspace  =5 align=left src="../images/new/James_Hellier_Rowe.JPG" width=257 height=368 >, 
Arborfield, on Saturday last, at the age of 73. </p>
<p>The deceased was a well-known farmer, and previous to going to Arborfield was 
at <b>Great Lea Farm</b>, <b>Three-Mile-Cross</b> for many years. He was a 
member of the <b>Shinfield Parish Council</b>, and was formerly one of the <b>
Guardians of the Wokingham Union</b>.</p>
<p>A keen exhibitor of Shorthorns at the various shows, he was a promoter and 
secretary of the <b>Shinfield Cottage Gardeners’ Show</b>, one of the founders 
and vice-president of the <b>Reading Devon and Cornwall Association</b>, and one 
of the stewards of the <b>Wokingham and District Agricultural Show</b>. He was a 
member of the Reading branch of the <b>National Farmers’ Union</b>, and was a 
popular figure at the <b>Reading market</b>.</p>
<p>The funeral took place on Thursday, when the body was interred in the family 
grave at <b>Shinfield</b>. Many neighbouring farmers and others attended to pay 
a last tribute of respect to one who was much esteemed by all. </p>
<p>[There followed a long list of mourners].</p>

<p><span lang="en-gb">&nbsp;</span><img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">'<b>James Hillier Rowe</b>' was listed in the 1920 
Electoral register for the parish of Newland as resident at <b>Targett’s Farm</b>. 
Back in 1913, it was in the hands of <b>Frederick John Bosley</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The first mention of James Rowe, in the 1851 Census, was as 
an 8-month-old son of <b>William and Ellen Rowe</b>, of <b>Ottery St. Mary</b> 
in south-east Devon. He was the fourth child, and his 11-year-old his eldest 
brother John was already described as an 'Agricultural labourer', just like his 
father. The family had a lodger, 76-year-old widow <b>Mary Hellier</b>, who was 
described as a 'Pauper'. By 1861, James was a 'scholar', still living at West 
Hill, Ottery St. Mary. This time, Mary Hellier was listed as a 'visitor', aged 
'88'.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">People's ages often get mis-quoted for various reasons, and 
by 1871, James had matured to '25'; he was by now a 'Farm Servant' at <b>Rushett 
Farm, Malden, Surrey</b>, with 28-year-old wife <b>Ellen</b> (originally from <b>
Sidmouth</b>), and 11-month-old son <b>John</b>, born in <b>Exeter</b>. Perhaps 
James wanted to disguise the age difference between himself and his wife.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By 1881, James had progressed to being a 'Farm Bailiff', 
living at <b>Great Lea Farm</b>, and the<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Emma, John and Minnie Rowe, about 1877" vspace  =5 align=right src="../images/new/Emma_John_Minnie_Rowe.JPG" width=275 height=408 > 
Berkshire air must have rejuvenated him; he was only 33. James and Emma had a 
7-year-old daughter <b>Minnie</b>, born in Leatherhead, and a domestic servant. 
The photo of Emma, John and Minnie was probably taken around 1877.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 1891 Census revealed that James was now a farmer in his 
own right, aged 42 while Minnie was 48. They continued to enjoy the help of a 
domestic servant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By 1901, James' rejuvenation was complete; he was now only 
50. Their daughter Minnie was now married, and had two young sons <b>Herman 
Adams</b>, aged 2 and <b>Leonard Adams</b>, aged 1, both born in Bracknell; 
there was no sign of Mr. Adams in this Census.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the late 1800's there was a shortage of tenant farmers 
in Berkshire, and many came from Devon and Cornwall to make up the shortfall. 
Some of those who farmed in Arborfield were known to have come from Devon, and 
one day we shall know the full story of the <b>Reading&nbsp; Devon and Cornwall 
Association</b>. If you have any information, please contact us.  </p>
