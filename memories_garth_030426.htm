        <p class="stbody"><b>Thomas Colleton Garth Esq.</b> of Haines Hill, was Master 
        of his own hounds from 1852-1902, and to celebrate his 50 years, the 
        hunt was named “The Garth” in his honour. He was the son of Capt. Thomas 
        Garth [RN] and was one of the best, most popular Masters in the country, 
        a Justice of the Peace, and Deputy Lieutenant of Berkshire.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In 1852, the “Opening Meet of Mr. Garth’s Hunt” was 
        held at Haines Hill, with Robert Tocock as huntsman and Henry Tocock 
        [his son] and Thomas Sweetman as the first and second Whippers-In.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The Hunt met mostly in Berkshire and Hampshire, and 
        locally at <b>Barkham Square and Newlands</b>. This continued until the 23rd 
        March 1962 when the last meet took place on The Green at Sherfield on 
        Loddon, prior to the amalgamation with the South Berks Hunt on 1st May 
        1962. Miss Effie Barker of Stanlake Park, Master of the Garth Hunt for 
        its last 26 years, was also Master of the newly amalgamated Garth and 
        South Berks Hunt for a further 4 years. The Hunt still exists, although 
        an attempted amalgamation with The Vine failed in the 1990’s.
        
        </p>

        <p class="stbody">As well as regularly hunting foxes, the Garth 
        organized their own <b>point to point races</b>. The first of these was 
        organized by Edward Sturges J.P. of Barkham Square in 1904. Other venues 
        used included Ashridge and Ashridgewood Farm, Wokingham; the <b>Army 
        Remount Depot, Arborfield</b>; the <b>Newlands Estate, Arborfield</b>; Lordlands 
        Farm, Hawthorne Hill and Cowfold Farm, Rotherwick.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The races were often attended by royalty such as H.R.H. 
        The Prince of Wales [later Edward VIII], The Duke of York [later George 
        VI] and Prince Henry [later Duke of Gloucester].</p>

        <p class="stbody">On 15th March 1924, both the Prince of Wales and 
        Prince Henry competed in two races. In the last race, the Prince of 
        Wales fell from his mount Little Favourite whilst attempting to jump a 
        ditch. He was carried to the Moat House, and then driven to Aldershot, 
        where he remained for a few days, before being driven to St. James’ 
        Palace where, due to concussion, he was kept in a darkened room for 
        three weeks.<br>
        <br>
        The Times on 17th March 1924, reported the fall:<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>ARMY POINT TO POINT MEETING</b><br>
        <br>
        The Army Point to Point Meeting was held in fine weather at Arborfield 
        Cross on Saturday. By the fall on his mount Little Favourite, in the 
        last race of the afternoon, the Prince of Wales was kicked in the face, 
        suffering painful but not serious injuries</i><br>
        <br>
        The Remount Point to Point course at Arborfield, where both Army and 
        Garth Hunt meetings took place, are now Army barracks and housing. From 
        the start, the course ran along the southern side of Kidgem Copse, the 
        main covert on the Barkham Square estate, crossing Biggs Lane and later 
        crossing the then A327 Arborfield to Eversley road.</p>

        <p class="stbody">For some years now, all Point to Points have been held 
        at Tweseldown Racecourse, near Aldershot.<br>

        <font SIZE="3">
        <p class="stbody">In the mid-1920's and probably for a much wider 
        time-span, the Reading Mercury reported in detail on the Hunt season 
        from September to the Spring, followed by Point-to-Point races. 
        Virtually every week there were photographs of Hunt meetings, some of 
        which were in and around Arborfield. In addition, a correspondent would 
        contribute a column on the <b>Garth Hunt</b>, and others would write on 
        the <b>South Berks</b> and related Hunts, including <b>Drag-Hunts</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="stbody">Judging by the number of column inches devoted to the 
        subject, Hunting was almost as much a spectator sport as was Football. 
        Each chase was described in graphic detail, usually listing the most 
        eminent taking part, and often describing the poor fox as 'Mr. Reynard'. 
        In 1926, Arborfield was mentioned about every three weeks, either as a 
        place of meeting or as part of a wider circuit.</p>
        <p class="stbody">Strangely, the 'Bramshill Hunt' Public House was 
        barely mentioned except in passing. The 'Bull' and the 'Mole' were 
        listed far more frequently. The descriptions of each chase reveal how 
        much has changed since that time, even without considering the change in 
        attitudes to blood sports. For example, nowadays it would be impossible 
        for a pack of hounds and a large group of riders to cross Sindlesham 
        Road without injury or death, since traffic speeds are much higher than 
        they were in the days when country roads were mainly gravel. </p>
        <p class="stbody"><i>From February 6th 1926:</i></p>
        <p class="stbody">There was a photograph of the 'Meet of the Farley Hill 
        Beagles at Arborfield Cross', showing the 'Bull' in the right background 
        and the Parish Cottages to the left.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The Garth Hounds met at Mr. John Simonds' residence, 
        Newlands, where all followers were most cordially welcomed. [There were 
        four photographs, captioned as follows:]</p>
        <p class="stbody">(1) Hounds moving off over the hill at the back of the 
        house to draw the first cover, where a fox was quickly found and

        column, not reproduced here.]</p>

        <p class="stbody">The Garth dog pack met on Wednesday, at the Greyhound, 
        Finchampstead. ... One fox crossed the road and ascended the steep hill. 
        Leaving the church on the right, hounds ran their quarry over the 
        Nine-mile-Ride, through Longmoor, over to Kidgham and by Barkham, over 
        the road to the Coombes into Bear Wood, where they were run out of 
        scent. Hounds cast about in the Coombes, hoping to pick up their hunted 
        fox, but failing this, they came back to Barkham and drew Kidgham 
        through. The next draw was the covers near the Arborfield Remount, and a 
        fox was soon found, which led hounds away with a merry cry round 
        Whitehall and Westlands.</p>
        <p class="stbody">Leaving Arborfield Cross on the right, he crossed the 
        road pointing for Moor Copse, then bearing left-handed went on to the 
        Swallowfield Park covers, then re-crossed the road, running with some 
        delightful music through the Farley Hill covers. Keeping to the left, he 
        ran on by the Bound Oak towards Farley Castle, then turned back by 
        Westlands and Whitehall, to be killed in the open on the hill between 
        the Bound Oak, Farley Hill, and Arborfield, after a really good hunt.</p>

        <p class="stbody"></p>
        <p class="stbody">The Garth dog pack met on Wednesday at Bear Wood 
        Mansion. This is known now as the Royal Merchant Seamen's Orphanage, and 
        is under the care of Captain Wilson, R. N., who kindly invited the 
        hounds to meet at the Mansion, instead of the Bear Wood Lodge as 
        advertised. All were most grateful to Captain Wilson for his generous 
        hospitality. It did me good to see the orphan children looking down on 
        the sporting scene. A fox was found immediately, but scent was very 
        catchy and hounds could not make much of him. They drew the cover 
        through Bear Wood Park, then went to the Coombes, where a fox was found, 
        but the scent was indifferent. </p>
        <p class="stbody">Eventually the fox was viewed away, and with a much 
        improved scent outside, hounds ran him round by Newlands, leaving the 
        Mole on the right, on to Carter's Hill, and after a really nice hunt, 
        hounds marked their fox to ground near a hedge adjoining Mr. Dymond's 
        Farm at Carter's Hill. They were then taken on by Harman's Corner, and 
        drew the covers just beyond Sindlesham, those towards Sindlesham Mill, 
        and in the osier beds, between the mill and Carter's Hill. </p>
        <p class="stbody">A fox was viewed away over the fields towards Bear 
        Wood Park. They were quickly on the line, and this fox, turning 
        right-handed, came back into Carter's Hill and broke away in the open 
        towards the Mole. He was making for the earth, where digging was being 
        continued for the other fox that had been previously run to ground, but 
        finding people there, he turned back into Carter's Hill covers again. 
        Hounds were pretty fairly close to him at times in the cover near Mr. 
        Dymond's Farm, but eventually he made his escape in the open over to 
        Bear Wood Park and he ran hounds out of scent. </p>
        <p class="stbody">Hounds then made a cast back, and on to Mr. 
        Hargreave's gorse, belonging to Arborfield Hall, where another fox was 
        found. At first, he looked like going towards the church, but turned 
        back and ran into Carter's Hill covers, and after dodging hounds for a 
        time, he broke away across the field into Bear Wood Park and through the 
        Bear Wood covers until he ran out of scent.</p>
        <p class="stbody">Hounds then came back through Bear Wood Park and went 
        on to Carter's Hill where they were more successful in killing the fox 
        that had previously run to ground. This ended the day's sport. </p>
        <p class="stbody">[A long list of participants followed, including 'Mr. 
        John Simonds, Mr. P. Simonds, Mr. V. Simonds, and Mrs. and Miss Simonds, 
        and many others.'] </p>
