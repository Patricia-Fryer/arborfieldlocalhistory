The <b>Allright</b> or <b>Allwright</b> family owned land in Arborfield and the 
surrounding parishes for centuries.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; a plaque 
at the back of neighbouring Barkham Church states: </p> 
       
<p class="stbody" align="center"><b><i>Mrs. Alice Alwright gave to the Poor of this

<p class="stbody">In Arborfield, a Deed or Indenture dated '15th January in ‘the 
5th Year of Sovereign Lady Ann’, held at Berkshire Record Office, describes </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">'That Messuage or Tenement and Piddle of land thereunto 
adjoining and belonging now in the possession or occupation of <b>Richard 
Alwright</b> situate lying and being at Arborfield Cross in the Parish of Hurst 
in the said County of Berks between the Tenement and lands heretofore of Sir 
Henry Kingsmill Knt. now or late in the possession of <b>Thomas Alwright</b> on 
the North and North East . . <br>
And the Street called Arborfield Cross . . . . '</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">There are several other references in other Deeds to <b>Thomas 
Alwright</b> (one in the 1st year of the reign of George II; another on 27th 
December 1723).</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">This piece of land seems to the same as that shown in the 1839 
Tithe Apportionment Map, numbered 81, 82, 83 and 86:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">
<img border="0" src="images/Tithe8_chapel.jpg" width="556" height="356"></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Here are the details of these and surrounding properties:</p> 
       
<b>
<p class="stbody">77 = Bull P. H. - Messrs. Willats Blandy<br>
<i>81 = Chapel - The Methodist Society <br>
82 = Cottage &amp; Garden - William Lyford<br>
83 = Cottage &amp; Garden - James Holmes<br></i>
85 = Granary - Messrs. J &amp; C Simonds<br>
<i>86 = ‘Oliver’s Pightle’ - Messrs. J &amp; C Simonds</p></i></b> 
       
<p class="stbody">There were some other pieces of land in what is now called 
Church Lane, numbered 56, 57 and 58: </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i><b>56 = Black Well - Mr Elisha Groves<br>
57 = House &amp; Garden - Daniel Knutt<br>
58 = Cottage and part of garden - Daniel NUTT - sublet to Henry BURRETT</b></i></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The Allrights provided the land for the Chapel and continued 
to own the property while the congregation used it. The family wasn't involved 
in preaching, but <b>John Allright</b> was listed as an Overseer of the Chapel 
in 1838.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">This John Allright was the son of another John Allright, who 
left a Will that was proved in 1836.&nbsp; This reveals a lot about the Allright 
family. Here's a simplified summary:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b><i>Will of John Allright of Swallowfield</i></b></p> 
       
<ul>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>All land in Langley Common to his son John Allright, plus 
land at Chapmans near Hurst; also Barn and Stable on newly-enclosed land at 
Langley Common; also Meeting-House and two tenements at Arborfield Cross; plus 
estate at Reading<br>
Daughter Hannah Allright to get £950</i></p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Grand-daughter Elizabeth Allright Targett to get £1000 in 
trust till age 21</i></p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Interest on this sum to father John Targett for 
maintenance, clothing &amp; education</i></p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>John Targett was promised the house he occupied at 
Sindlesham in a house that John Allright had bought from Devisees of John 
Simonds</i></p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Hannah was bequeathed ‘all my household goods and furniture 
plate linen and china victuals liquors and Fuel’</i></p> 
       
  </li>
</ul>
       
<p class="stbody" align="right"><i>Dated 18th July 1821 <br>
Executors: John Allright, John Targett and friend Samuel Slaughter (a baker of 
Reading) </i><br>
&nbsp;</p> 
       
<p class="stbody" align="left">First Codicil, 14th January 1833:</p> 
       
<ul>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Withdrew land at Sindlesham, but offered it to John Targett 
for sale at the original price; the sum to be divided between him, John Allright 
and Hannah</i></p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Hannah’s money to be protected against debts, power or 
control of any husband. If she dies without issue, money to be divided among:<br>
John Allrights’s children Joan Elizabeth, John and Alfred, and <br>
Elizabeth Allright Targett, daughter of the late Elizabeth Targett</i></p> 
       
  </li>
</ul>
       
<p class="stbody">Second Codicil, 25th March 1834:</p> 
       
<ul>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Gave to John Targett ‘the Meetinghouse or Building made use 
of as a chapel or place of public Worship for protestant Dissenters situate at a 
place called Arborfield Cross in the parish of Hurst, keeping up, repairing and 
maintaining it, bounded with a pale fence on the north side and the west end 
thereof, <br>
on condition that John Targett and his heirs permit and suffer the same to be 
used as a place of public worship for Protestant Dissenters in such a manner as 
the same is now made use of for that purpose – as long as the Congregation will 
assemble therein for that purpose’</i></p> 
       
  </li>
</ul>
       
<p class="stbody">Third Codicil, 8th November 1834, after Elizabeth Allright 
Target had died:</p> 
       
<ul>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>The £1000 sum for her was revoked, along with any share as 
a residuary legatee, and the interest on the money for John Targett</i> (so she 
was still under 21), <i>and also the Meeting-House.</i></p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Instead, he was to get the two closes of land adjoining his 
own house and premises at Sindlesham. </i></p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>The Meeting-house was now to go to his daughter Hannah 
Allright during her life, and then reverting to his son John Allright.</i></p> 
       
  </li>
</ul>
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Proved at London with 3 codicils on 22nd November 1836 
before the Judge by the three Executors, to whom Admon was granted</i><br>
<br>
A John Targett was a Deacon at the Chapel in May 1838, but it is not clear 
whether he was the same person as mentioned in the Will.&nbsp; </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The John Targett in the Will was the prime mover behind the 
building of Sindlesham Baptist Church. He was a Baker at Sindlesham, and he 
entered into an appointment of the piece of land and a Declaration of Trust with 
the following people:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Rev. John Howard Hinton of Reading (Protestant Dissenting 
Minister), <br>
Rev John Coles of Wokingham, Dissenting Minister, <br>
Samuel Porter of Wokingham, watchmaker,<br>
William Porter of Wokingham, linen draper,<br>
Stephen Sale of Wokingham, Gardener,<br>
Charles Targett of Bray, Baker,<br>
Philip Davies of Reading, Grocer,<br>
Samuel Collier of Reading, Grocer,<br>
William Beckley of Reading, Grocer,<br>
Henry Jackson of Reading, Tallow Chandler,<br>
Samuel Elkens Phillips of Reading, Cabinet Maker,<br>
Samuel Gostage of Reading, linen draper,<br>
George Cleare of Sindlesham, Baker,<br>
Frederick Williams of Reading, Ironmonger.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The first interment at Sindlesham was <b>Elizabeth Allright 
Targett</b>, aged 15, in 1834.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">John Targett re-married 3 times, to Eleanor, who died in March 
1837 a few weeks after giving birth to John (he died aged 10 months); Susan, who 
died in 1845; and Jane Maria, who died in 1877.&nbsp; John Targett died in 1866, 
and all are buried at Sindlesham. His son Edward Chase Targett inherited the 
house in Sindlesham, but sold it to John Walter of Bearwood. The Chapel was 
rebuilt in 1868. Did some of the money come from John Targett? It seems that 
there was a donation from John Walter to ensure that the new building was in 
keeping with his model village.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">There were continuing connections in Arborfield for both 
Allright and Targett families, as these entries from Post Office Directories 
show:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">~1847: <b>Small Wesleyan Chapel</b><br>
