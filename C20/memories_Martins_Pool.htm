      <p>Martin's Pool in Wokingham was a well-known local 
      attraction for Arborfield folk, and its closure in the 1990s was much 
      lamented. Many local children learned to swim there even after a swimming pool was installed on 
      behalf of the Schools Association&nbsp;in the grounds of Arborfield, Newland and Barkham 
      C.E. Junior School in the 1960s.</p>

      <p>The next week on 26th May, the 'Reading 
      Mercury' reported the opening ceremony as follows:</p>
      <p align="center"><strong><font

      <p align="center"><strong><font

      <p>The new swimming pool which has been constructed at 
      “Fernleigh”, Wokingham, by <strong>Ald. W. T. Martin </strong>and his son, 
      <strong>Mr. Cathrow Martin</strong>, was officially opened on Saturday, in 
      the presence of a large company. These included the <strong>Mayor of 
      Wokingham (the Rev. C. Mansfield)</strong>, <strong>Lady Victoria 
      Villiers</strong>, <strong>Ald. P. Sale</strong>, <strong>Mr. W. M. 
      Colebrook</strong>, <strong>General Grant Wilkinson</strong>, 
      <strong>Captain Evans</strong>, <strong>Mr. E. S. Whaley</strong>, 
      <strong>Alderman A. F. Clark (Reading)</strong>, <strong>Mr. L. L. 
      Rogers</strong>, <strong>Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Chapman</strong>, <strong>Dr.

                 , 
      etc.</p>
      <p>Alderman W. T. Martin, in introducing the Mayor, 
      said for over thirty years he had been trying his utmost to get a swimming 
      pool for the Borough of Wokingham. When he went on the council 34 years 
      ago it was one of the planks in his election address that they should try 
      to do something to teach the children to swim. They had gone on from year 
      to year, but all their schemes had fallen through. So he had now 
      endeavoured to find something off his own bat. He hoped they had succeeded 
      in producing a bathing place acceptable to all. <em>(Applause).</em> They 
      had taken a good deal of trouble to find out the very best. They had the 
      purest water for them to bathe in, so that they could come there and feel 
      absolutely safe. They had adopted one of the finest water purifiers they 
      were able to find. The whole of the designs had been got out by his son. 
      <em>(Applause).</em> They had found a very able man as contractor in Mr. 
      Barrett, who had spared no efforts to carry out to the last letter 
      everything so that they would have a swimming pool that would be hard to 
      surpass. Through the construction of the pool they were able to find work 
      for a large number of men, who had worked willingly. They had put their 
      backs into the job, and no hours had been too long in order to get it 
      finished by that day. He felt very proud of the whole of the workmen who 
      had been engaged on the job. <em>(Hear, hear).</em></p>
      <p align="center"><strong><font size="4">1,100 TONS 
      EXCAVATED.</font></strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Mr. F. J. Barrett</strong>, the contractor, expressed his 
      thanks to Alderman Martin for giving such a swimming pool to Wokingham. He 
      was very proud of the job, and he thought he had some reason to be. He 
      also thanked Mr. Cathrow Martin for his designing of the pool, which had 
      made his work look so much better, and for the very happy way in which 
      they had been able to work together. He also desired to thank his own 
      employees for the good work they had put into the job and the goodwill 
      with which they had carried it out. They had worked long hours to get the 
      job completed, so that at two o'clock that day he was able to say that the 
      job was finished. </p>
      <p>Actually 1,100 tons of soil had been excavated, and although they could 
      not see it, this was still in the garden. This was due to Mr. Martin's 
      excellent designing. The amount of shingle, sand and gravel used was 650 
      tons. Other quantities included 116 tons of cement and twelve tons of 
      reinforcements. If the electrician's wire used was measured it would 
      probably amount to the same mileage as that which they had covered in 
      running round looking at various swimming pools in the country. </p>
      <p>Mr. Barrett then presented Mr. Martin with an inscribed silver-mounted 
      ebony walking stick on behalf of himself and the workmen. Mrs. Martin was 
      handed a bouquet of carnations. </p>
      <p align="center"><b><font size="4">A Man of Enterprise.</font></b></p>
      <p>The Mayor of Wokingham said the idea of a swimming pool had been a pet 
      scheme of Alderman Martin's for many years, and as he could not get the 
      council to spend the money to put the matter in hand, he had, with great 
      enterprise, undertaken the work himself. <em>(Applause).</em> Alderman 
      Martin was a man who had the best interests of the town of Wokingham at 
      heart, and they now saw one of the results of that interest. They had a 
      contractor in Mr. Barrett who had put his whole heart into the job, and it 
      was due to his energy and good management that the pool was ready to be 
      opened that day. The workmen, too, had carried out their job well. In 
      designing such a pretty pool, Mr. Cathrow Martin had done excellent work. 
      He hoped the whole town and, indeed, the neighbourhood, would take 
      advantage of this provision for the health and welfare of the district. 
      The best sign of their gratitude would be for them to make as much use of 
      the swimming pool as they possibly could.</p>
      <p>On behalf of Ald. Martin the Mayor then presented a packet of money to 
      each of the workmen.</p>
      <p>The opening ceremony was followed by a swimming display. The opening 
      splash was given by lady members of the Reading Swimming Club, and this 
      was followed by a diving display by Miss L. L. Cullum (champion of 
      Hampshire) and Miss M. Cullum. Exhibitions of various strokes were given 
      by Mr. S. Bell (Windsor Swimming Club), ex-champion of England, Miss J. 
      Edminson (Reading Swimming Club), champion of Berks, and Miss L. L. 
      Cullum. Polo matches were played between Reading ladies and Hounslow 
      ladies, and Reading men and Windsor men. The display concluded with an 
      aquatic exhibition by members of the Reading Swimming Club, and by the 
      Four Lucratics of the Highgate Swimming Club.</p>
      <p>The swimming pool is 110 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 9 feet deep at 
      its greatest depth. The water at one end falls over a glass cascade, which 
      is illuminated from underneath. It then runs down a series of stone steps 
      into the pool. Underwater lighting has been provided for the pool itself, 
      so that no lights will be apparent to the eyes. The swimming pool is 
      constructed of concrete, with a snowcrete facing, which gives it a pure 
      white appearance. At the end of the pool opposite to the steps is a 
      Venetian bridge, with three diving boards, two six feet and one twelve 
      feet in height. In addition to the main swimming pool, there is a circular 
      pool, 2ft. 6 in. deep, for the children. This pool has its own illuminated 
      cascade.</p><p" designtimesp="16026">
      <p></p>
      <p>The pools are in charge of <strong>ex-Chief Petty 
      Officer W. Gunnee, R.N.</strong>      
           , who has been instructor to the 
      Royal Navy at Portsmouth for twelve years. He is the holder of the bronze 
      medallion and bar, and the sword of merit of the Royal Life Saving 
      Society, of which he is a first-class instructor and examiner. </p>

         <em>
      As teenagers in the 1940s my friends and I visited this great outdoor swimming 
      pool on many occasions. My friends were the swimmers; I just put 
      my swim
      suit on just to get wet, did a bit of paddling around the 
      edge, hanging on to the hand-rail in fear. I enjoyed watching people diving off 
      the boards into the pool with a mighty splash and then surfacing; to me it was 
      just magic.         </em>
      </p>      
      <p><em>Apart from the main pool there
      was a small paddling pool for the 
      tiny children. Also, 
      the lawns and gardens were a perfectly lovely place 
      to relax in.</em></p>
      <p><em>There was a drowning of a local lad from Anderson Crescent. He went 
      swimming at lunch times from his place of work. I don't know what happened 
      to cause his drowning. At this time in the 1950s I was in a sanatorium and 
      didn't get any other information – only that he drowned. </em></p>
      <p><em>I was saddened when Martin's closed. </em></p>
