        trees are oaks. One noteworthy example, known as <b>Bound Oak</b>, tree 
        no. 4197 on the database, is so old that it has long since 
        hollowed-out and decayed; however, in the second decade of the 21st

  <font face="Verdana" size="2">
        The boundary between Arborfield and Swallowfield is still marked by a tree, <br>called the Bound Oak, which must be quite 650 years old, called that for the reason that, when the bounds of a parish were beaten on Rogation Days, and prayers were said by the priest, boys were beaten on the Boundary so as to remember it;  <br>in some places the lord of the manor was beaten.  <br><br>This oak stands at the end of a lane which may possibly have been a Roman road, and has that tradition, joining the Devil's High Way, which was an early British road running straight from Staines to Silchester, 
        the latter being a very important Celtic and then Roman town.</font></b></i></p>

        <p class="stbody">The tree can easily be found on the <b>Ordnance Survey

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">Even on the old six-inch Ordnance

      <p class="stbody"><font size="2">On this portion of the map, the road running

      is on the junction of <b>Castle Hill</b> and <b>Wokingham Lane</b> (off 
      the map to the right). By the way, <b>Westlands Copse</b> has long since 
      gone, as has the brick kiln opposite <b>Tanners Farm</b>. Notice just how 
      many wells served the locality in the 1870s.</font></p>
      <p class="stbody"><font size="2">As of 2011, two segments of the hollow trunk 
      are lying on the ground. However, about a third of the trunk remains

      size=2><strong>Westlands</strong> was blank. The next draw was <strong>Mr. 
      Allfrey’s covers</strong> in <strong>Farley Castle Park</strong>, and then 
      hounds proceeded over the road into the <strong>Big Wood</strong>. A 
      <em>view holloa</em> was heard back towards <strong>The Bound 
      Oak</strong>. Hounds ran towards <strong>Long Copse</strong>, and the fox 
      turned short back and through <strong>Farley Castle</strong> covers, and 
      was viewed over the top part of <strong>Farley Hill</strong> back into the 
      <strong>Big Wood</strong>. </font></p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">Later hounds got well on 
      the line, running round <strong>Hemmses</strong> with quite a good scent 
      and a splendid burst of music, and seemed quite close to the fox at times. 
      Eventually he broke away over the <strong>old lane</strong>, and ran round 
      the <strong>Big Wood</strong> and got to ground just on the top part of 
      the <strong>Big Wood</strong>. At <strong>Farley Hill Place</strong> a fox 
      was found, which led hounds over to the lower part of 
      <strong>Wyfolds</strong>. </font></p>
        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">Hounds then drew all 
      through <strong>Wyfolds</strong>, the gravel pits and gorse by <strong>Mr. 
      Bowyer’s farm</strong>, and then <strong>Wheelers</strong>, and after a 
      time a fox was on foot. Hounds hunted him round the cover and then across 
      from <strong>Wheelers</strong> into <strong>Wyfolds</strong>, and back to 
      <strong>Wheelers</strong> again, but scent seemed to fail.</font></p>
