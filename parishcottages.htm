<p class="stbody">After 1894, Council Housing was provided by <b>Wokingham Rural 
District Council</b>, but many Parishes had their own stock of houses which were 
gradually closed down, usually after being condemned for being 'unfit for human 
habitation'.&nbsp; We have quite a lot of information on Arborfield's Parish 
Cottages, but only one photograph. The Cottages in Swallowfield Road faced the 
Bull public house, shown here from across the old village pond.</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Arborfield Parish had six 
        cottages to rent,&nbsp; while Newland had none; on the other hand,&nbsp; the 
        Newlands Estate had many cottages for its workers (see the <b>
        <a href="A_N_1947.htm">Newlands Estate Sale document for 1947</a></b>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1895,&nbsp; the two Parish cottages 
opposite the Bull Inn needed repairs. Two tenders were received, one from Mr 
Lydiard of Wokingham and one from George Garrett,&nbsp; who was also the Parish Clerk 
and who lived near "The Bull".&nbsp; Mr Garrett tendered&nbsp; £27/10/-, and this was 
accepted.&nbsp; His tender gives us a good idea of the condition of the cottages.&nbsp; It 
was as follows:</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i><span lang="EN-GB">"To Captain Stuart Rickman,&nbsp; R.N,&nbsp; 
and Overseers of the Parish of Arborfield.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Payment took time, instalments being 
paid when half-yearly rents were paid:&nbsp; £9/15/- in March 1896 and again in 
November,&nbsp; and the final £8/-/- by a precept on the Overseers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">In November 1898,&nbsp; a meeting was held 
to consider the question of repairs to the two chimney tops and the re-thatching 
of the roofs of the four Arborfield Parish cottages near the pillar box - in 
what was referred to as Lower Arborfield.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1901, insurance on the six cottages 
was increased to £75.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The annual meeting in 1907 "decided 
that the tenants of the six parish cottages should be notified that they should 
in future be weekly tenants and give or receive one week's notice, and that the 
rent viz. 1/3 per week or 5/5 per Calander Month (sic) be paid monthly, to Mr. 
A.E.Scrivener,&nbsp; Overseer of the Parish."</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Various repairs were carried out in 
later years,&nbsp; usually by the Garrett family.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1918, it was reported that the 
tenants in Lower Arborfield had complained of the difficulty in drawing water 
from the well by means of a bucket and hooked stick,&nbsp; and it was suggested that 
a pitcher pump be costed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Necessary repairs to the Parish 
Cottages were carried out - by Garrett Bros. - in 1926,&nbsp; after correspondence 
with the Ministry of Health, who were planning to condemn them. The list of 
repairs was extensive.&nbsp; Even after this,&nbsp; a small sub-committee of the Annual 
Meeting was set up to consider further repairs.&nbsp; They reported back in June with 
the following list:</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i><span lang="EN-GB">"The pair of cottages at Arborfield 
Cross: -</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Take off and re-fix the whole of 
the ridge and hip tiles and repair the slating.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Rake out and make good all the 
defective pointing of the brick-work.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Brean's cottage: -&nbsp; Put a new

</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">After these were completed,&nbsp; the WRDC 
Sanitary Inspector requested that more repairs were needed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="en-gb">Here's a view of the cottages in March 
1937, when a horse-drawn snow plough was used to clear the Swallowfield Road 
(with acknowledgements to the 'Reading Mercury'):</span></p>

<p>The cottages at Greensward Lane were further repaired, by Messrs. A. Barker 
and Son, in 1938. WRDC paid 2/3 of the cost. </font><span lang="EN-GB">Again in 1946,&nbsp;the cottages were 
re-thatched. </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">By 1956, the Greensward Lane cottages 
had been supplied with electricity&nbsp; (as had the pre-war Council Houses); the Swallowfield Road cottages were condemned.&nbsp; By 1962,&nbsp; those in Greensward Lane 
were also condemned.</span></p>
