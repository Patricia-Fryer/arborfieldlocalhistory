<p align="center" class="sthead"><b><font size="4">DEATH OF MR. WALTER, OF 
BEARWOOD. </font></b></p>
<p>With very sincere regret we have to announce that Berkshire has lost yet 
another of its well known and representative men, who was also one of the 
largest land-owners. After but a few days’ illness, <b>Mr. Arthur Fraser Walter</b> 
expired on the evening of Tuesday last at his stately residence, Bear Wood, near 
Wokingham. The tidings of his death has called forth a deep feeling of sorrow as 
well as sympathy with his widow and family; and a keen sense of loss is felt 
throughout the county, and especially in his own neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Less than three weeks ago Mr. Walter was taken ill with an attack of 
influenza, but he apparently did not realise the gravity of the attack, and when 
feeling and looking far from well he was out shooting with friends. Whether he 
then took a chill, or thereby aggravated the attack, is not known; however, from 
some cause pneumonia supervened, followed by complications, and notwithstanding 
the best of nursing and the most careful medical treatment, his condition became 
very serious, and he fell into a comatose state, in which condition he remained 
for several days, until he passed peacefully away shortly after nine o’clock on 
Tuesday evening, at the age of 64.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Walter did not take any very prominent part in county affairs, 
beyond those which generally fall to the lot of a country gentleman and an owner 
of a large estate, yet the Walter family have for so many years been honourable 
and prominently connected with Berkshire that it was only natural that a keen 
sense of sorrow should be felt at the tidings of his unexpected death.</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Fraser Walter was a County Magistrate for Berkshire, also a 
Deputy-Lieutenant of the County, High Steward of the town of Wokingham, and a 
member of the Berks County Council. He was also formerly Lieut.-Colonel and Hon. 
Colonel Commandant of the 1<sup>st</sup> Volunteer Battalion Royal Berks 
Regiment, in which he served for several years. He was also a member of the 
Berkshire Territorial Force Association from its commencement. In his younger 
days he took very great interest in the Volunteer Movement, and for many years 
regularly attended the Annual Camp of his battalion. The town of Wokingham is 
indebted to him for the splendid Drill Hall and Armoury, which he erected there 
when he commanded the Wokingham Company, with which his name will ever be 
associated. He also did all in his power to encourage a high standard of rifle 
shooting amongst his men by attending their practices and shooting with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Fraser Walter was the second and eldest surviving son of Mr. John 
Walter, of Bear Wood, for several years M.P. for Berkshire. He was born at 
<b>Waterloo House</b>, near Wokingham, on September 12<sup>th</sup> 1846. He was 
educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1870 
and M.A. in 1875. He took a first class in Classical Moderations, but was only 
placed in the Third Class in the Final Classical School, partly because he had 
no great inclination for the studies and subjects which gain distinction in that 
school and possibly because he was devoted to cricket.</p>
<p>Mr. Walter played for Eton against Harrow in 1864 and 1865. He also got his 
Blue for cricket at Oxford and in the 1869 match bowled effectively.</p>
<p>Mr. Walter married in 1872 <b>Henrietta Maria</b>, eldest daughter of the <b>Rev. T. A. 
Anson, of Langford Rectory, Derbyshire</b>. His widow and four children – two sons 
and two daughters – survive him. He is succeeded by his elder son John, who was 
born in 1873, and married in 1903 <b>Charlotte Hilda</b>, daughter of <b>Colonel C. E. 
Foster, of Buckley Hall</b>.</p>
<p>The Walter family have always been closely connected with <i>The Times</i> 
newspaper, which was founded by the first John Walter in 1785 as the <i>Daily 
Universal Register</i> and renamed The Times at the beginning of 1788. Mr. 
Arthur Walter, on the death of his father in 1894, became manager and chief 
proprietor of <i>The Times</i>. About two years ago a limited company was 
formed, and at the time of his death Mr. Walter was Chairman of <i>The Times</i> 
Publishing Company (Limited).</p>
<i>
<p>The Times</i> of Wednesday last published a lengthy 
      memoir of the deceased, and in giving a sketch of his life the writer 
      says:- </p>
<p><i>As the second son, it was 
understood that Arthur Walter would adopt a definite profession. But the idea 
was abandoned when his elder brother, <b>John Balston Walter</b>, was drowned in the 
lake at Bear Wood on Christmas-eve, 1870, while attempting to rescue one of his 
brothers and a cousin, who had fallen through the ice. By the untimely death of 
his brother, young Arthur Walter became, while he was still an undergraduate at 
Oxford, the destined successor to his father in the management and chief 
proprietorship of The Times – a position which had always been held by 
the head of the family. Arthur Walter accordingly entered Lincoln’s In and was 
called to the Bar by that society in 1875, but he never practised. In fact, 
shortly after taking his degree he became associated with his father in the 
management of The Times, and in 1880 he was formally appointed joint 
manager. From that time forward, and indeed from an earlier date his whole life 
was given to The Times. </i></p>
<p><i>On the death of his father in 1894 he became in 
his turn manager and chief proprietor, and retained that position until two 
years ago, when he exchanged it for that of <b>Chairman of The Times Publishing 
Company, Limited</b>. That company was formed with a capital of £750,000, and 
Mr. Walter was chosen Chairman. </i></p>
<p><i>Mr. Arthur Walter’s life offers very little material for public record. 
His father was an eminent and respected Member of Parliament and his name was 
for that reason consistently before the public. Mr. Arthur Walter, on the 
contrary, rarely came before the public at all. To his neighbours in Berkshire 
he was a country gentleman whom private affairs frequently called to London. He 
was a Justice of the Peace, a Deputy-Lieutenant, High Steward of the town of 
Wokingham, and some years ago he became a director of the <b>London and 
South-Western Railway</b>. Mr. Walter took a great interest in landscape 
gardening on a large scale, and was often actively engaged in carrying out his 
ideas. He inherited a taste for bricks and mortar from his father, and set a 
very high standard of building for workmen’s cottages on his estate.</i></p>
<p>The writer of the memoir thus concludes:- </p>
<p><i>It was only to those who were associated with him that the real interest 
and work of Mr. Walter’s life was known. To his colleagues and subordinates he 
was known as a firm friend, a generous employer, a just man, a kindly gentleman. 
He held strong opinions, but he knew how to trust his colleagues, his heart was 
warm, his integrity was inflexible, and none ever appealed to his kindness in 
vain.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">THE BEAR WOOD ESTATE.</font></p>
<p>Bear Wood is a fine and well-known Estate, about 2½ miles from Wokingham, and 
five from Reading. It was formerly an outlying part of Windsor Forest, and still 
retains some of its primitive wildness. Its name is supposed to have been 
derived from the Saxon word "bere", signifying a farmyard in a wood. It is noted 
for its fine rhododendron walks, its extensive flower and kitchen gardens, and 
its finely timbered pleasure rounds. Also for the magnificent Lake of some 40 
acres in extent, containing several islands; there is also an upper lake 
covering about three acres.</p>
<p>The Mansion was rebuilt by the late Mr. John Walter between 1865 and 1869. It 
is a stately and imposing edifice of red brick, with Mansfield stone dressings, 
and contains a handsome suite of reception rooms and a spacious picture gallery; 
and some 90 bedrooms. Mr. Walter took great interest in improving the gardens 
and grounds – and also in the Estate generally.</p>
<p>The <b>Sindlesham Schools</b> were built by the late Mr. John Walter and enlarged in 
1896; and are now capable of accommodating 250 children. The picturesque and 
substantially built houses on the road to <b>Bear Wood Church</b> were also erected by 
Mr. Walter.</p>
<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">JOURNALISTIC TRIBUTES.</font></p>
<p>In the passing of Mr. Arthur Walter we lose the representative of a great 
name in English journalism (remarks the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>). What the 
Walters have done to uphold the dignity and the influence of the Press is less 
known to the public than it is to journalists themselves, and by them it is 
freely recognised and acknowledged. For a century the <i>Times</i> has stood as 
the criterion of the English newspaper, and its imitators and competitors have 
never achieved quite the same position or influence. There could be, in fact, 
only one <i>Times</i>; this has been a tradition, and a proud one in the Walter 
family, and none held closer to it than the able and amiable English gentleman 
who has just passed away. We hope, for the sake of English journalism as a cult, 
that t he tradition will be continued by those who come after him in the 
exercise of authority at Printing House-square.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Daily Newspaper Proprietors’ dinner in London on Wednesday, 
Mr. E. H. Johnstone referred sympathetically to the death of Mr. Walter. <i>The 
Times</i>, he said, had probably done more to establish the reputation of the 
newspaper Press and profession than any other newspaper. He thought they might 
with great advantage send a message of sympathy to Mrs. Walter and members of 
the family, and he moved accordingly. Mr. A. R. Byles seconded the motion, which 
was carried in silence, all present standing. The Hon. Harry Lawson, M.P., 
replying to a toast later in the evening, also referred to the late Mr. Walter, 
and said the Walters had been the greatest dynasty in the realm of journalism. 
They could not find a finer type of English gentleman than Mr. Walter, in the 
best meaning of those words. He was worthy in every respect of those he 
succeeded, and, of course, he came into a great inheritance. The Walters had 
occupied the highest place it was possible in British journalism, and for a long 
time they were the presiding directors of <i>The Times</i> when it stood almost 
alone for the influence of the Press among British journals. It would be a long 
period before they found a man more straightforward and more honourable in his 
life than the late Mr. Arthur Walter. </p>
<p>The late Mr. A. F. Walter’s powers of judjment were good and sound. A 
crowning proof of this is the fact – that as he himself told the writer – (of 
"Office Window Notes" in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>) – that both he and Mr. 
Buckle, editor of the "Times", were decidedly opposed to the publication of the 
<b>Pigott letters</b>, though they were overruled by Mr. John Walter and Mr. MacDonald, 
the then manager, both of whom may be said to have been killed by the results of 
their mistake of judgment. Mr. Arthur Walter on the same occasion added that the 
<b>Parnell case</b>, from first to last, had cost the "Times", in money alone, 
something like £150,000.</p>
<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">THE FUNERAL</font></p>
<p>The funeral of Mr. Walter will take place at St. Catherine’s, Bear Wood, 
to-day (Saturday), at 2.30 p.m. For the convenience of those wishing to attend 
it a special train will leave Waterloo for Wokingham at 1 o’clock, returning at 
3.45. Conveyance from Wokingham Station to the church and back will be provided.</p>

Walter's funeral and of several tributes:</p>

<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">THE FUNERAL AT BEAR WOOD</font></i><font size="4">.</font></p>
<p class="sthead" align="center">----</p>
<p>With marked simplicity <b>the ashes</b> of the late <b>ARTHUR FRASER WALTER, the Squire 
of Bear Wood</b>, were laid to rest on Saturday afternoon in the beautiful God’s 
acre of St. Catherine’s, Bear Wood, a church erected opposite one of the gates 
of the Park and one of the many standing proofs of the public munificence and 
wise prescience of his revered father, the late Mr. John Walter. </p>
<p>The ceremony – the more impressive and dignified by its total freedom from 
"pomp and circumstance" – was attended by a notable concourse of personages in 
the front ranks of society and literature, as well as by very many county 
gentlemen and representatives of the working classes of the neighbourhood, all 
assembled to show their honour to the memory of one truly respected and greatly 
esteemed not only for the important position he filled in the public life of the 
country and county but for his personal qualities, and also to show their deep 
sympathy with the bereaved relatives.</p>
<p>Following on a fortnight of storm and gloom [<i>the 'Mercury' had reported 
hurricanes in parts of Berkshire</i>], the weather on Saturday 
afternoon was brilliantly fine, which was fortunate for the hundreds of 
sorrowing friends and dependents who stood reverently outside the church on 
account of its limited seating capacity. There were no signs of conventional 
mourning in the ordinary sense, but the Union Jack and the St. George’s Cross 
floated at half-mast from the mansion and the church respectively.</p>
<p>The remains of Mr. Walter had been <b>cremated</b> on the previous day at <b>Woking</b>, 
and subsequently the urn containing the ashes was placed on a stand covered with 
a piece of Eastern embroidery in the chancel of St. Catherine’s Church, where it 
was watched through the night by employés<b> </b>on the estate. In front of it 
was a cross of white flowers sent by <b>General Sir Herbert Chermside</b>, while at the 
foot of the pedestal, upon the floor of the chancel, lay <b>an open book worked in 
flowers</b>, the gift of <b> <i>The Times</i> Companionship</b>. This beautiful offering, 
the covers of which were worked in magnolia leaves, was composed of white stocks 
edged with Parma violets. Roses, lilies of the valley, heather, and orchids, all 
of pure white, were introduced into the open pages of the book, which were 
divided by a ribbon of mauve-coloured silk bearing, in letters of gold, two 
brief words: "At Rest". The members of the clerical and mechanical departments 
of <i>The Times</i> had subscribed for this striking emblem, which they offered 
as a token of respect. </p>
<p>A few other wreaths and floral tributes were sent by members of the family 
and intimate friends, but the number was not large, as an intimation had been 
given that no flowers were desired. These were placed along the Communion rail. 
On the Holy Table were vases of white flowers, and the font was also beautifully 
decorated, while on the other side of the chancel steps the head gardener (<b>Mr. 
W. Barnes</b>) had arranged a group of palms and white flower.</p>
<p><b>Miss Jeacock</b>, the organist, softly played selections from Spohr’s "Last 
Judgment", and also Smart’s "Offertoire", and "I know that my Redeemer liveth", 
"But the Lord is mindful of His own", during the assembling of the congregation, 
and "O rest in the Lord" as the funeral urn was borne from the church.</p>
<p>The service was taken by the Rev. W. V. Vickers, the Rector of St. 
Catherine’s, Bear Wood, who read the opening prayers, the Rev. C. A. Whittuck 
(late Rector of St. Catherine’s and now Vicar of St. Mary the Virgin, Oxford), 
who read the Lesson, and the Rev. Dr. Warre, Provost of Eton, who said the 
committal prayers. The urn was borne from the appointed moment placed in the 
grave by Mr. Barnes, the head gardener and forester on the estate. At the 
conclusion of the service Sergt. Hawkins, a "Times" commissionaire, sounded the 
"Last Post" on his bugle – an appropriate tribute to the memory of one whose 
uncle, Sir Edward Walter, founded the Corps, which is now commanded by Major 
Walter, and who was always greatly interested in its well-being.</p>
<p>The urn was deposited in a circular sunken bed, beautifully situated, and 
lined with moss, studded with lilies of the valley, white azaleas and <i>aetus</i> 
tulips, and bordered with white narcissi and purple burberis. [NOTE: The 
circular memorial is now in stone, as seen here:]</p>

<p>The <b>Rector of Bear Wood (the Rev. W. V. Vickers)</b> preached on Sunday morning 
to a large congregation. Taking as his text the words: "David, after he had 
served his own generation, fell on Sleep", he showed how the ideal life is to 
serve one’ generation, either as in the case of the great ones of earth, in 
public; or, in the case of all, in private. Mr. Walter might be said to have 
done both. </p>
<p>For 16 years he was responsible for the conduct of the premier Newspaper of 
the world, guiding public opinion in the soundest paths, in support of Church 
and State – yet entirely effacing his own personality. "But we, in Bear Wood 
(the preacher went on to say), had to do with his private life. Naturally 
reserved as he was, we had, if we wanted to see him, as a rule, to go to him. 
But then, the very grip of his hand, told us in a moment of the welcome that was 
ours, and of the warmth of his heart. If we went merely for the pleasure of a 
general chat, we came away feeling the better for it. If we went in some 
difficulty, seeking advice, we came away feeling instinctively, that we had had 
the very best, leaving us in no doubt as to how we ought to act. He was 
thoroughly downright, sacrificing not one iota of duty for the sake of 
popularity. And yet, of his popularity, amongst all sorts and conditions of men, 
we had the very amplest proof, in the crowds who attended his funeral yesterday.</p>
<p>"Of all the many testimonies which have appeared of his sterling worth, it is 
worthy of notice that the highest and truest to life come from those who have 
been most closely associated with him either as colleagues or subordinates". 
After quoting two of these, the Rector concluded: "And now that life on earth is 
closed! Owing to the high position which Mr. Walter held in the country as a 
public man, and in the country as owner of many broad acres, his life was, 
necessarily, loaded at times with the cares and anxieties, inseparable from 
positions of responsibility. And yet his love of games, and his youthful – he 
might say boyish – spirits helped him marvellously to throw them off. A keen 
lover of animals, the antics of his favourite dog were sufficient to draw from 
him, at any moment, a hearty laugh. Thus in the stern business of life, in its 
relaxations, and last, but not least, in the observance of religious duties, 
Arthur Fraser Walter has left us a worthy example, and now he "has fallen on 
sleep". It is remarkable how often the Bible speaks of death as "sleep". As he 
lay there, in the wonderful beauty of that peaceful sleep, the thought was 
forced upon one, how, (as we sing in one of our Psalms to-day) "God giveth His 
beloved sleep". Yes! That sleep is God’s gift – His last gift to him – His last 
gift to us. </p>

<p>At the opening of the Reading County Divisional Court on Saturday Captain 
Cobham, the Chairman, referred to the decease of Major Thoyts; and proceeded to 
say that the County had also to regret the loss by death of another prominent 
Magistrate, who had been a member of the Magistracy of the County during the 
greater part of his valuable life, and who had died at a comparatively early 
age. </p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Walter was a member of the neighbouring Bench of the Wokingham 
Division, and he devoted all the time he could spare from his many very 
important pre-occupations to the business of the County. He was a member of and 
a regular attendant at the meetings of the County Council, and was always ready 
to take his part in anything for the benefit of the County at large. He was sure 
they would wish to convey their condolences and sympathy to Mrs. Walter and the 
other members of the family. The resolution was carried <i>sub silensio</i>. </p>

<p>From Page 4, the <b><a href="families_Ditchfield.htm">Rev. Peter Ditchfield</a></b>, 
Rector of Barkham, gave the sermon at his church:</p>
<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">THE LATE MR. WALTER.</font></p>
<i>
<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">In Memoriam.</font></p>
</i>
<p class="sthead" align="center"><font size="4">----</font></p>
<p>Much regret has been felt in the village on account of the death of Mr. 
Walter, the squire of the parish. On Sunday a muffled peal was rung both at the 
morning and evening services. The hymns "Brief life is here our portion" and 
"The Sower went forth sowing" were sung, and at the close of each service the 
"Dead March" in "Saul" was played by the organist, <b>Mr. Stanley Perkins</b>, 
the congregation standing. </p>
<p>In the morning the Rector preached and dwelt upon the great loss which the 
village had sustained, and asked for the prayers of the congregation for the 
widow and children of the late squire.</p>
<p>The Rector said – It is my duty to say a word to you this morning with regard 
to the loss we have sustained by the passing away of the squire of this parish. 
We have at the request of his family been praying for him during the last two 
weeks, and the knowledge that your prayers have been ascending to God for him 
has been a great comfort to them during these sad days. God has called him to 
rest from the many anxieties that pressed hardly on him during his earthly life; 
to-day we pray for those whom he has left behind – they need our prayers still, 
that God will comfort them in their sadness, their loneliness, and bereavement. 
Death that knocks equally at the door of palace and cottage has removed from 
them one they dearly loved. We will think and pray for them to-day, and ask God 
to comfort their desolate hearts.</p>
<p>The Rector continued – <b>Mr. Walker, the Squire of this parish</b>, comes of a 
family that has done great service for this country. They founded and conducted 
the greatest Newspaper in the world, which has become a national institution, a 
Paper remarkable for its fearlessness and the free expression of unbiased 
political opinions. But we are concerned more with the private life, rather than 
the public services of the family.</p>
<p>Less than 100 years ago (1830) the second Mr. John Walter bought from the 
Crown some land at Bear Wood, and built for himself a house. The prosperity of 
the family increased; Mr. John Walter 3<sup>rd</sup> built the mansion we know 
so well. In 1874 he bought this <b>Barkham estate</b>, and became its Squire. 
All over this district we see buildings erected by him; churches, schools, 
rectories, farms, cottages. The chancel of this church, the rectory, were built 
by him and everyone recognised him as a great benefactor, a man with a large 
heart and wide sympathies, who took a keen personal interest in the welfare of 
the parishes on his estate, performing many acts of pure and personal kindness 
which have long endeared his memory. </p>
<p>And he, who has just passed away, mourned by so many yesterday in Bear Wood 
Churchyard, tried to follow in his father’s footsteps. You will have read the 
tributes paid to his memory by many writers, his colleagues in the Press, his 
friends, but he shone most, I think, in his home life, when outside worries 
could for a time be shut out, and surrounded by the affection of his family he 
was at peace. May he rest in peace now, life’s trouble o’er:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now upon the further shore<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lands the voyager at last.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Father in thy gracious keeping<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.</p>
<p>The soul is independent of these our bodies wherein for a time it dwells. It 
matters not whet happens to our body, whether it be slain in battle, lost at 
sea, reduced at once to the dust and ashes whence it came, or laid quietly in 
the grave, as our usual custom is to bury. The soul is independent of such 
accidents, and the teaching of science blends with the belief of our holy faith. 
 
</p>
<p>We believe in the Communion of Saints, and this a great scientist defines as "a 
fellowship of all the beings who help and love each other, some of them known to 
us, others at present unknown. Some of these are on the earth, others are not, 
but friendship and faculty will survive bodily death, and affection bridge the 
chasm. Death is a natural step of transition from a more to a less material 
stage of existence, and should be neither hastened nor feared. It can result in 
actual enlargement of memory and personal consciouances" [sic]. We are glad to 
have that testimony from one of the world’s greatest thinkers. </p>
<p>What kind of memorial would you like to leave behind you, when the few years 
of this fitful life are ended? Everyone can leave behind a record of good works, 
of duty faithfully performed, of work conscientiously done. Sometimes we grow 
weary in well-doing. We lose heart, cease to try, and give up. And so we need 
refreshing. God gives us His Grace in order to refresh us, to infuse new 
strength into our souls. We come to Holy Communion; we receive that Grace, and 
then start afresh, boldly onward, and try again to do our duty more perfectly . 
. . .</p>
<p>What can we do for our Lord, Who has done all for us? We can show a 
consistent witness for Jesus. We can try to break up all false notions and 
traditions. Remember you have a field for work, for service, in your home, your 
work, in the wider field of His Church. Lay your life down before the altar, and 
say "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? Teach me to do Thy will, to spread the 
knowledge of Thee, to show my love for Thee?" And then be not weary. We are so 
tired sometimes, when things do not turn out well, and we are discouraged, and 
people are stupid and foolish, and quarrelsome and tiresome. Never mind; God 
knows that quite as well as you do. </p>
<p>Do not let us give up. Some young Oxford men were spending a summer vacation 
in a reading party in the country, and they resolved to have a race across 
country. One man was left far behind, and long after the others had come in, and 
they had forgotten all about the race, an ungainly poor runner was seen plodding 
along and running as hard as he could. That man is now a Bishop, one of the 
foremost leaders of the Church, a leader in judgment and power, a leader amongst 
leaders. He has gone on plodding away, and that has led him to what he is 
to-day. So do not let us give up. "Be not weary in well-doing, for in due time 
we shall reap if we faint not".</p>
<p>In the evening the sermon was preached by the <b>Rev. E. Lyddekker</b>, curate of 
All Saints’, Wokingham.</p>
