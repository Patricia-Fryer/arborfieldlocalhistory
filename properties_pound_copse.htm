        <p class="stbody"><i>Article 'Pound Copse' taken from 'Your Village', 
        1983:</i></p>

        <p class="stbody">Pound Copse is a small attractive tract of woodland, 
        some 2.31 acres in extent lying on the west side of Greensward Lane. It 
        is covered by a preservation order and comprises the remnant of a much 
        larger area of woodland cut down to make way for arable cultivation in 
        the 1960’s.<br>
        <br>
        The copse was most generously donated to Arborfield and Newland Parish 
        Council in Jubilee year, 1977, by the Samuel family and was taken over 
        by the Council, following legal conveyance in 1980.<br>
        <br>
        Despite its size it contains a wealth of trees and shrubs mainly 
        indigenous but including the usual foreign introductions such as Spanish 
        Chestnut. The usual selection of trees to be found in mixed deciduous 
        woodland in Southern England is evident including oak, ash, hornbeam, 
        holly, silver birch and wild cherry. Willows are evidence of dampness in 
        the lower parts of the copse and of particular interest are two wild 
        service trees, a species which is becoming rarer and rarer although one 
        of the oldest of British trees, whose berries were used by Romans to 
        make a ‘Home Brew’. The undergrowth is mainly bramble interspersed with 
        shrubs, such as hazel and buckthorn, patches of bluebells and areas 
        where wild honeysuckle grows in profusion.<br>
        <br>
        It is the aim of the Parish Council to open up parts of the woodland to 
        the public, primarily a sinuous footpath running through the wood and 
        providing an alternative route to the existing footpath along the side 
        of the wood. Some thinning of the trees will take place to let more 
        sunlight into large areas of the copse, a proportion of the undergrowth 
        will be cleared out to a certain extent to expand the present seasonal 
        pond. A large number of dead trees will be felled but enough will be 
        left to provide habitat and feeding grounds for woodpeckers, tree 
        creepers and nuthatches. Although it is normally only animals and birds 
        that are in the front of people’s thoughts when considering conservation 
        it must be remembered that dead wood also provides ideal conditions for 
        a variety of insects and fungi. A considerable quantity of undergrowth 
        will be left to provide nesting areas for wrens, robins, whitethroats 
        and other small birds.<br>
        <br>
        This work started by volunteers from the Berkshire Conservation Group in 
        February 1981, but the whole project which will take several years to 
        complete and will require regular annual maintenance.<br>
        <br>
        The copse should provide a lot of pleasure not only for the residents 
        but also to visitors of the village.<br>
        <br>
        (<b>Noel Sudbury</b> was Chairman of the Council at a meeting with the
        <b>Hon. Mr. Peter Samuel</b>, and suggested the gift of Pound Copse to 
        the village in consideration of the loss of a short bridleway - but not 
        conditional upon the closure.) <br>
