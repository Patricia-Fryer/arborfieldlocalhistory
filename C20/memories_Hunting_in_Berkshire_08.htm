This is from Article 8 of the 30-article <b>‘Hunting in Berkshire’ </b>series by
<b><a href="families_Cope.htm">J. Hautenville Cope</a></b>, which was published 
in the ‘Reading Mercury’ on April 9th 1921.<p align="center"><b><font size="3">
HUNTING IN BERKSHIRE</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">By J. Hautenville Cope.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">(ARTICLE VIII.)</font></b></p>
<p>In the last article it was related how the country was united under <b>Mr. 
Wheble</b>. Before long a desire arose to revert to a division similar to the 
one which took place in 1813.</p>
<p>To deal with this question, which ere long became a "thorny" subject, a 
meeting was held on Feb 16<sup>th</sup> 1852 at the <b>Bear Inn, Reading</b>, 
with <b>Mr. J. Bligh Monck, of Coley Park</b> in the chair, when the following 
letter was read from <b>Mr. Wheble, Bulmershe Court</b>, dated December 20<sup>th</sup>, 
1851:-</p>
<p><i>"Dear Monck, - as secretary of the South Berks Hunt, I beg to inform the 
members that I shall resign the management of the hounds and country at the end 
of the season 1851. I thank you for your duties in the hunt and I thank those 
gentlemen who have kindly supported me. I beg to say also that I shall continue 
to hunt the country as I please and in the way I shall consider the best to show 
sport.</i></p>
<p><i>I remain, dear Monck, yours truly, JAMES WHEBLE."</i></p>
<p>It was proposed by <b>Mr. Allfrey </b>and seconded by <b>Mr. Garth</b>, <i>
"That the thanks of the country be given to Mr. Wheble for the sportsmanlike and 
handsome manner in which he has hunted the country for the past two seasons"</i>. 
This proposition was unanimously carried. </p>
<p>The next proposal was made by <b>Mr. Garth</b> and seconded by <b>Mr. 
Standish, of Farleigh Court</b> (now the residence of <b>Mr. Bishop</b>): <i>
"That the Garth should take that portion of the country hunted by Sir John Cope, 
with the addition of the part lying between the London Road and the Thames, and 
to hunt three days a week, assisted by a committee"</i>; to this <b>Mr. Montagu</b> 
moved an amendment, which was seconded by <b>Mr. Allfrey</b>: <i>"That this 
meeting do not sanction any division of the country till every effort has been 
made to hunt it as a whole"</i>. </p>
<p>By seven votes to four <b>Mr. Montagu’s</b> amendment was carried; <b>Mr. J. 
J. Blandy </b>then made the following proposal, having for its seconder <b>Mr. 
Porcher</b>: <i>"That a committee, consisting of the chairman, Messrs. <b>Thoyts</b>,
<b>Allfrey</b>, <b>Garth</b> and <b>Standish</b>, be appointed to consider the 
best mode of hunting the country as a whole and of finding some gentleman 
willing to take the hounds for that purpose"</i>. This resolution was 
unanimously carried. </p>
<p>The meeting adjourned till March 13<sup>th</sup> – that is, for a month – 
when it was expected, or at least hoped, that the committee would make a report.
</p>
<p>The adjourned meeting accordingly took place at the Bear Hotel on March 13<sup>th</sup>, 
but the committee made no report. <b>Mr. Garth</b> made an offer to take the 
country on the understanding that he would not hunt the <b>Yattendon side</b> or 
the <b>Oxfordshire side</b>. <b>Mr. Standish</b> and <b>Mr. Conroy, of 
Arborfield Grange</b>, proposed and seconded respectively that the offer of <b>
Mr. Garth’s</b> be accepted, but to this suggestion <b>Mr. Wheble </b>proposed 
and <b>Mr. Allfrey</b> seconded, <i>"That in the event of any gentleman 
undertaking to hunt the Yattendon side of the country, Mr. Garth be required to 
give up to them the country west of the Loddon"</i>. By ten votes to eight <b>
Mr. Wheble’s</b> amendment was carried, with the result that <b>Mr. Garth</b> 
withdrew his offer. The meeting adjourned for a fortnight.</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 20<sup>th</sup>, 1852, <b>Mr. Wheble</b> wrote the 
following letter to <b>Mr. Monck</b>:-</p>
<p><i>"Bulmershe, March 20<sup>th</sup>, 1852.</i></p>
<p><i>"Dear Monck, - As no one has come forward to take the whole country, and 
as I stated I was prepared to hunt a part, I presume that I still hold the 
country and I beg to withdraw my letter resigning the country. I beg you to tell 
Mr. Garth or anyone else who may propose to keep hounds that I intend to hunt 
the <b>Yattendon</b> country and the <b>Mortimer</b> country west of the <b>
Loddon</b> and the <b>Whitewater</b>; that should the Vine still permit me to 
draw their country, they may hunt on the east side of the <b>Loddon</b>; that as
<b>Mr. Cobham’s</b> coverts are near to <b>Farley Hill</b>, they may draw them 
unless specifically desired not; that I am prepared to give up twenty couple of 
hounds or as many more as I can spare.</i></p>
<p><i>Yours truly, J. J. Wheble".</i></p>
<p>The contents of this letter were communicated by Mr. Monck to Mr. Garth, who 
wrote as follows to Mr. Wheble:-</p>
<p>"<i>Haines Hill, Reading, March 25<sup>th</sup>.</i></p>
<p><i>"Dear Wheble, - I have received a letter from Mr. Monck on the subject of 
the division of this country, the purport of which is that you, as former Master 
of the country, resign the whole and give me what you please. I deny that you 
can hold that position; but supposing, for the sake of argument, my withdrawal 
to hold good (which, however, I do not allow), you having resigned the 
mastership some time ago, having accepted a vote of thanks, and start again in 
the private position of a gentleman offering to take a country, and having 
clearly and decidedly resigned, cannot now say, ‘I will be Master of the hounds 
again' without consulting the gentlemen of the hunt and being accepted as such 
by them. </i></p>
<p><i>"Such being the case, I consider you have no right to give me certain 
portions of the country and to withhold others, and it is not my intention to 
abide by that arrangement, but to draw the whole of <b>Sir John Cope’s</b> late 
country this side of the <b>Loddon</b>, <b>Beech Hill</b>, and the coverts we 
propose to take west of the <b>Loddon </b>near <b>Mr. Cobham’</b>s and <b>Mrs. 
Willes’ </b>places, unless warned off from doing so by the proprietors; giving 
up <b>Bulmershe</b>, <b>Mr. Palmer’s</b> coverts at <b>Sonning</b>, <b>Maiden 
Erlegh</b> and <b>Whiteknights</b>, by which arrangements I hoped, and still 
hope, that the dispute may be brought to a satisfactory and friendly conclusion.</i></p>
<p><i>I am, yours truly, T. C. Garth."</i></p>
<p>This letter of Mr. Garth’s created a "great excitement", though now, after 
the lapse of half a century and more, the whole affair is no doubt forgotten 
except by a few whose families then were resident within bounds of the country 
which was in dispute. So great was the "excitement" that the following letter 
was sent to the secretary of the South Berks Hunt: -</p>
<p><i>"To J. Bligh Monck, Secretary, South Berks Hunt Club,</i></p>
<p><i>"We, the undersigned subscribers to Mr. Wheble’s hounds, having seen a 
letter from Mr. Garth to Mr. Wheble in which he states that it is his intention 
to draw the whole of Sir John Cope’s country this side of the Loddon, request 
you to circulate the proceedings of the late meetings held at the Bear Inn, 
Reading, as well as the subsequent correspondence, with a view to place all 
persons concerned in possession of the grounds of the present misunderstanding 
preparatory to a future meeting. </i></p>
<p><i>"<b>E. Gilbert East</b>, <b>H. L. Hunter</b>, <b>M. G. Thoyts</b>, <b>
Robert Allfrey</b>, <b>A. Morrison</b>, <b>Darnwood Fowles</b>, <b>S. Bazelgette</b>,
<b>G. H. Montague</b>.</i></p>
<p><i>"28<sup>th</sup> March 1852".</i></p>
<p>Mr. Monck accordingly circulated copies of the letters already quoted in this 
article, and at the same time issued the following notice: -</p>
<p><i>"Coley Park, April 6<sup>th</sup>, 1852.</i></p>
<p><i>"In compliance with the above requisition I beg to forward you a copy of 
the proceedings and correspondence. I have since the receipt of the requisition 
entreated Mr. Garth to reconsider the steps he has taken or to submit to 
arbitration as proposed by Mr. Wheble, but he has declined doing so.</i></p>
<p><i>I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J Bligh Monck".</i></p>
<p>So acute did the feeling become, so charged with electricity was the hunting 
atmosphere, that one sportsman who was a resident in the country which 
afterwards became Mr. Garth’s sent a challenge to another gentleman, who dwelt 
in the Kennet valley. <b>"Coffee for one and pistols for two"</b> were not 
needed, as the challenger thought it prudent to retire to the Continent for a 
time to cool his ire; he also was persuaded to offer an apology to the person to 
whom he had sent the challenge. Thus the incident closed without resort to such 
an antediluvian method of settling a quarrel. Tact, as it always does, prevailed 
in the end; the country was divided during the year 1852; <b>Mr. Garth</b> took 
the territory the <b>east side of the Loddon</b>, the other side, the western, 
fell to the share of the <b>South Berks</b>, of which hunt <b>Mr. Wheble</b> 
became master till the end of the season 1853-54, when he resigned and <b>Mr. 
George Montagu</b> became Master for the second time.</p>
<p>Commenting on the "division", the late <b>Major Thoyts</b> has very 
trenchantly observed in his notes on the South Berks Hunt: <i>"It appears to be 
an open question whether anyone could claim the country west of the Loddon 
except by permission of the Vine. A matter which neither party seems to have 
taken into consideration!"</i> In support of his views Major Thoyts quoted an 
account of <b>the Vine</b>, who at the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century met at
<b>Loddon Bridge</b>. This run, taken from the papers in my possession, has 
already been given in a previous article. </p>
<p>During the time <b>Captain Mainwaring</b> was Master of the Vine (1832 to 
1834), that pack in the season 1833-34 drew <b>Sulhamstead</b>, <b>Grazeley</b>,
<b>Mortimer</b> and <b>Butler’s Land</b> to prove their right to this tract of 
country. Later, that is when <b>Mr. Whieldon</b> was master of the Vine 
(1835-36), he asked the South Berks to give him a formal acknowledgement that 
the <b>Kennet</b> side of the country was hunted on sufferance. This request was 
readily complied with and included the area from <b>Pamber Forest to Pinge Wood</b>. 
All this district was hunted by <b>Mr. Chute</b>, the founder of the Vine 
Hounds, till he lent part of it to <b>Mr. St. John</b> and after Mr. St. John 
had retired Mr. Chute continued the loan to <b>Sir John Cope</b>. This option of 
Mr. Chute castigated Major Thoyts in his belief that the Vine at the time hunted 
the country between the Kennet and the Loddon.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Garth</b> thus commenced his long career as a <b>M.F.H.</b>, which 
lasted half a century. </p>
<p>Much has been written of this fine old sportsman; no pen, certainly not mine, 
can do justice to him, either as a Master of Hounds or as a landlord. One of the 
finest specimens of an English country gentleman, he was beloved and respected 
by all with whom he was brought in contact, and when he passed away it was 
universally felt that one had disappeared from our midst to whom the words of <b>
Tennyson</b> so well applied:-</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>And thus he bore without abuse,<br>The grand old name of gentleman.</i></b></p>
<p>[From <b>Article 9</b>, April 23rd:]</p>
<p>Since the last article was published in the "Reading Mercury" of April 16<sup>th</sup>, 
I have, through the kindness of a friend, been generously allowed to see some 
further correspondence which was not amongst the <b>Sulhamstead papers</b>. I wrote 
that the gentleman who sent the challenge of a duel went abroad, and was made to 
apologise for sending the challenge. I now find that I was not correct, and I 
have pleasure in correcting my remarks. It appears that the person who sent the 
challenge did not go abroad, and that the one who received the challenge was the 
person who made the apology. A great deal of correspondence, some of a very 
unfriendly nature, took place between these two people, which gave rise to the 
incident just mentioned.</p>
