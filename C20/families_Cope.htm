<p class="MsoNormal">Although <b>Bramshill</b> is across the border in 
Hampshire, the ‘Bramshill Hunt’ extended north through Arborfield and beyond the 
Bath Road, and of course the local pub gained its name from the hunt meetings. The <b>Cope</b> family owned <b>Bramshill House</b> from 1700 until 
the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century, when it passed to <b>Lord Brocket</b>. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" alt="The facade of Bramshill House, from Jeans, G. E. (Ed.): “Memorials of Hampshire.” (1906)" src ="../images/new/Bramshill_Facade.jpg" width=500 height=343 ></p>

<p>We have a potted history of the Cope family, as quoted in the Victorian 
County History of Hampshire, published in 1911. Under ‘Eversley’, we learn how 
the Cope family came to own Bramshill House, and how Bramshill came to be 
associated with <b>fox-hunting</b>:</p>
<p><i>"[Sir Robert Henley’s] brother and heir <b>Sir Andrew Henley</b> was 
equally extravagant, and fell so deeply into debt that he was forced to part 
with all his property, the Bramshill house and estates being sold by his 
representatives and creditors to <b>Sir John Cope</b> for £21,500 in 1700. </i>
</p>
<p><i>"Sir John succeeded to the baronetcy in 1721 and died in 1749, being 
followed by his son and heir <b>Sir Monnoux Cope</b>, who died in 1763 and was 
succeeded by his son and heir <b>Sir John Mordaunt Cope</b>. </i></p>
<p><i>"Sir John died unmarried in 1779, and the baronetcy and estates passed to 
his cousin <b>Sir Richard Cope</b>, who died without issue in 1806, and was 
followed by his nephew <b>Sir Denzil Cope</b>. [Elsewhere in this History, we 
read: ‘The deer were done away with by Sir Denzil Cope, baronet, between 1806 
and 1812.’]</i></p>
<p><i>"Sir Denzil died without issue in 1812, and his brother <b>Sir John Cope</b>, 
well known as a master of foxhounds and owner of celebrated horses, held the 
baronetcy and the Bramshill estates until his death without children in 1851, 
when they passed to his fifth cousin and heir <b>Sir William Henry Cope</b>. </i>
</p>
<p><i>"<b>Sir Anthony Cope</b>, third but first surviving son of Sir William, is 
the present lord of the manor of Bramshill, having succeeded his father on his 
death in 1892." </i></p>
<p>A lot of detailed information on the <b>Bramshill Hunt</b> and its successor, 
the <b>Garth Hunt</b>, was published in 1921 in a series of 30 articles on <b>
‘Hunting in Berkshire’</b>, by <b>J. Hautenville Cope</b>, a local historian.
</p>
<p><b>John Hautenville Cope</b>, born 1867, was the son of <b>William Henry Cope</b> 
(1811-1892, Rifle Brigade, Minor Canon of Westminster) and <b>Harriette Margaret 
Hautenville</b>, daughter of <b>Robert Jaffray Hautenville</b>. He married <b>
<a href="../properties_manor.htm">Emma Elizabeth Thoyts</a></b> in 1899, and they settled in Finchampstead. Emma 
outlived him by 7 years, dying in 1949; they are commemorated by a plaque in 
Eversley Church, and they are buried in the Cope family grave there. </p>
<p><b>Emma</b> was the eldest daughter <b>Major William Richard Mortimer Thoyts</b> 
and his wife, <b>Anne Annabella Puleston</b>. Although born in in Bryanston 
Square, Marylebone on 8 July 1860, Emma grew up at <b>Sulhamstead House</b>, 
where she gained a fascination for history. She wrote widely, particularly upon 
subjects related to Sulhamstead and the surrounding villages and the families 
who lived there. She transcribed many Berkshire parish registers and soon became 
a recognised expert on the reading of ancient handwriting. One of her few 
published works, <b>'How to decipher and study Old Documents'</b> (1893), is 
still in print today under the title 'How to read Old Documents'. Her many 
manuscript works are now in the Berkshire Local Studies Library in Reading. She 
also produced sketches, including two of the old <b>Arborfield Hall</b>, which 
would have held a fascination for her, because its architect was also involved 
with <b>Bramshill House</b>.</p>
<p><b>J. Hautenville Cope</b> had unrivalled access to <b>Sir John Cope’s</b> 
notes and diaries of the <b>Bramshill Hunt</b>, plus those of the <b>Thoyts</b> 
family. The series <b><a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire.htm">‘Hunting in 
Berkshire’</a></b> covered the whole of the old county, but some relevant 
sections have been transcribed and can be seen by clicking <b>
<a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire.htm">here</a></b>. </p>
<p>J. Hautenville Cope collaborated with the <b> <a href="families_Ditchfield.htm">
Rev. Peter Ditchfield</a></b>, rector of Barkham, on Volume 3 of the <b>Victoria 
County History of Berkshire</b>, published in 1906, and encompassing Arborfield 
and surrounding villages. They also worked together on articles connected with
<b>Berkshire Archaeology</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>J. Hautenville and Emma Cope both attended the <b>
<a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119899885/PDFSTART">
1931 Anglo-American Conference of Historians</a></b>, held in London.<span lang="en-gb">  </span>

<p><a name="J">J</a>. Hautenville Cope was long associated with the 'Reading Mercury', so it was 
not surprising that it gave a large spread to his Obituary on November 14th 
1942, despite the fact that the newspaper was limited to only 8 pages at the 
time:</p>

<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="J. Hautenville Cope" vspace="5" align="left" src="../images/new/J_Cope.jpg" width="250" height="333">We deeply regret to announce the death of Mr. John 
Hautenville Cope, who passed away at his home, Finchampstead Place, 
Finchampstead, aged 75. He was the youngest son (by the second wife, Miss 
Hautenville, of Dublin), of Sir William Cope, the 12<sup>th</sup> Baronet, of 
Bramshill Park, and was born there on September 12<sup>th</sup> 1867. </span>
</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">He was educated at Wixenford School, and was at Mr. 
Kirchhofers’ at Yateley. Like many others, he failed to pass into the Army, but 
joined the London Rifle Brigade Militia, resigning as captain. For some time he 
held a Government appointment abroad. In 1899 he married Miss Thoyts, of 
Sulhamstead Park, Berkshire. He became associated with the Royal Berkshire 
Hospital under his Father-in-Law, Major Thoyts, and took a practical interest in 
the institution. On going to London, he became a Governor of Westminster 
Hospital, private secretary to the great explorer, Sir Leopold McClintock, 
secretary and organiser of the Westminster Hospital Association, secretary to 
the Queen’s Jubilee Nurses, a working member of the Charity Organisation Society 
under Mr. Locke, and finally he was on the paid staff of the Victoria County 
History, to which he was nominated by the celebrated Horace Round. In 1935 he 
was appointed County Correspondent for Berkshire of the National Trust for 
places of historic interest.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Cope became a prominent member of the Hampshire 
Society and for some time edited, with the Rev. P. H. Ditchfield, the Berkshire 
Archaeological Journal. Later, he was Editor to the Hants. Field Club. He was 
secretary and editor of the Oxfordshire Record Society, 1927-1936, and was 
formerly Editor to the Powysland Club and the Montgomery Collections.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">By the wish of Bishop Talbot, of Winchester, he was 
ordained a Lay Reader in that Cathedral, but was refused ordination by Bishop 
Gore, of Oxford, who, it is said, disapproved of lay readers. Mr. Cope assisted 
in a good many churches in Hampshire.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In 1920, after a brief residence again in Yateley, his 
wife bought and presented him with Finchampstead Place. In 1924, Mr. Cope became 
a member of the Wokingham District Council and Board of Guardians and took an 
active part in local affairs. He was for a long period President of the 
Finchampstead Cricket Club, and was greatly interested in the Men’s Fellowship, 
and was elected an hon. member of the British Legion. He was associated with the 
local Parish Council, the Finchampstead Ridges Committee, etc. Mr. Cope was 
always courteous and anxious to help in every way. He was most courteous in 
illness.</span></p>
<p align="center"><b><span lang="EN-GB">THE FUNERAL</span></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The funeral took place on Tuesday at the Church of St. 
Mary in Eversley. The service was conducted by the Rector of Eversley, assisted 
by the Rector of Stratfieldsaye (Canon John Barker) and the vicars of Heckfield 
and Yateley. Mourners were: Lady Cope (sister-in-law), Miss Joan Cope (niece), 
Miss Thoyts (sister-in-law), Mrs. D. Hilton, Mr. C. o’Callaghan (male nurse), 
Mrs. M. MacLeod, Mr. G. Corim and Mr. G. Datten. The widow was unable to attend 
owing to illness.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The coffin was borne by three Home Guards, in uniform, who 
are in the service of the Cope family, and Mr. Mileham, of the Finchampstead 
Special Constabulary. [There was a long list of others present].</span></p>
