        <br>
        I live at <b>65 Woodcote Road Caversham</b> and am a <b>buyer of livestock</b>. In 
        October 1926 I purchased at an </font> <b><a href="Hall_Sale_1926.htm">
        <font face="Verdana, Tahoma,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, MS sans serif" size="2">auction sale</font></a></b><font size="2"> jointly with my father and 
        my sister the farm known as <b>Arborfield Hall Farm</b> and we actually entered 
        into possession of this farm in January 1927. The land we acquired in 
        this purchase included the fields through which a road or track passed, 
        which I now understand is being alleged to be a footpath with public 
        rights of way thereover. This track runs from the farmhouse to the 
        junction with an old country lane called <b>Barratts Lane</b>. My father died 
        In 1929 but my sister and I continued to own the farm until we sold it, 
        including the fields mentioned above, to the <b>University of Reading</b> in 
        1947.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">During the 20 years we owned this farm no use was made 
        of the disputed track by members of the general public. It was used 
        purely in connection with the farm for the purpose of obtaining access 
        to the fields in that area. We never used it as an access way to 
        Barratts Lane and it was never used by the public for that purpose 
        either.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">When we took possession there was a notice board at 
        the far end which stated <b>"Private No Thoroughfare"</b> or words to that 
        effect. This was close to a gate leading into the fields which was 
        usually kept shut. At the far end and giving access to <b>
        <a href="C20/Hall_Sale_1926_maps.htm#Map_4">Barratts Lane</a></b> was 
        an iron gate with barbed wire along the top. There was no stile nor any 
        place for a stile at that end. About half way along the track there was 
        another iron gate which was always kept shut.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">During the period we owned the farm there were 
        occasions when persons not employed at our farm started to walk down the 
        track. This was usually from the farmhouse end and I cannot remember 
        anybody making use of it from the other end. I have personally told some 
        such persons that the path was private and that they must go back and 
        not use it. It was only occasionally that I had to do this since it was 
        very seldom that any unauthorised person came that way, but sometimes on 
        Sunday afternoons people going for walks did try and make use of it. I 
        think during the War the notice board on the farm end did fall down. We 
        never replaced it because we were under the impression that the people 
        in the locality knew full well that they were not supposed to use the 
        path.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">With regard to the iron gate at the <b>Barratts Lane</b> end, 
        there had been <b><a href="properties_Cockleberry_Mansion.htm">two old cottages</a></b> used in conjunction with the farm, which 
        had been demolished before we purchased the farm, and it seems to me 
        likely that the gate was once used as an access way to these cottages.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">I am quite satisfied that the track is a farm road only and the public 
        have no rights over it at all.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><font size="2">DROVE WAY</font></b><font size="2"> - 
        <b>From ARBORFIELD HALL FARM to CARTERS HILL</b> 
        Claimed by Arborfield &amp; Newland Parish Council as a Public Footpath. A 
        statement of facts known to the <b>Clerk of the Parish Council, 
        <a href="families_bentley.htm#Arthur_Bentley">A.J. Bentley</a></b><br>
        <br>
        In addition to the statements read by older inhabitants than myself, I 
        hereby declare that at about the age of 7, i.e. in 1907, I spent a great 
        deal of time at Arborfield Hall Farm. The Bailiff for <b>
        <a href="WW1/WW1_Mrs_Hargreaves.htm">Mrs. Hargreaves</a></b> was 
        <b>Ernest Bowyer</b> (now deceased) and his son Frank was a life long friend. 
        He too died in 1941. In those early days together we used to watch 
        pedestrians using <b>Drove Way</b> and we tried to guess where they had come 
        from and which direction they would take on reaching Footpath 1A. 
        Frequently they went towards the river. Less frequently to visit the Old 
        Church. </font> </p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">There were only 3 or 4 dwellings at <b>Carters Hill</b> and 
        another called <b><a href="properties_Cockleberry_Mansion.htm">Cockleberry Mansions</a></b> at the end of what we knew as 
        HUNDRED ACRES. With only those few dwellings it can be well understood 
        we know the occupants familiarly, hence our interest in the strangers. Cockleberry Mansion was last repaired by me about 1920 but it was 
        subsequently purchased we understood by some Americans who rebuilt it 
        elsewhere. The present house known as Cockleberry is not authentically 
        named. </font> </p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">People also frequently went northwards by this 
        footpath for fishing and, at a plot of ground we knew as <b>
        <a href="Hall_Sale_1926_21.htm">The Gorse</a></b> the 
        best blackberries grew in abundance anywhere around. No one was ever 
        stopped from using this path. There was a private path, however, by the 
        side of the river which we were forbidden to use.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">When <b>Ernest Bowyer</b> relinquished his appointment as 
        <b>Bailiff</b> to take <b>Mungells Farm</b> at Hurst, the farm was taken by a
        <b>Mr. Hedges</b>, a London butcher. His bailiff was <b>Mr. Constable</b>. Being a 
        single man he lived with my parents and did not occupy the Farm House. I 
        cannot recall how many years Hedges held the farm but I believe he left 
        after Swine Fever had occurred. No one was ever stopped from using the 
        path in question nor did the question ever arise.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><font size="2">Mr. Kersley</font></b><font size="2"> was the next farmer and at that time I was 
        in the Boy Scouts and we were always using Drove Way, even to taking our 
        Trek Cart over it when we camped at Carters Hill. I joined the army in 
        1915 as a boy and was away until 1919. As the result of inquiries I 
        learn that Mr. Kersley was a kindly man and was more likely to co-operate 
        with the villagers than otherwise.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><font size="2">John Hargreaves</font></b><font size="2"> next took the farm and <b>James Druett</b> 
        was his bailiff. I did most of the repairs at Arborfield Hall Farm and 
        my services were ever in demand. I met John Hargreaves many times. If it 
        were not permissible to use Drove Way he would have been the first to 
        say so, but he never did. There was another path leading off Drove Way 
        to NE and joining up with Carters Hill Lane in the corner of Church 
        Copse There was a <b>well and a hand pump</b> by a small cluster of trees 
        half-way along this path. It was a mistake that this was not claimed 
        under the Survey. I have used both paths often, for a Sunday 
        afternoon walk in my courting days, as have very many others.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">After John Hargreaves sold the farm to <b>Mr. Holdstock</b>, 
        <b>Mr. Claridge</b> was the bailiff for a few years, I continued to do many 
        repair jobs at the farm and to his agricultural implements at the farm. 
        Except on one occasion when some Boy Scouts trespassed on his land have 
        I never heard him check anyone, and even on that occasion he told them to 
        keep to the ROAD, for Drove Way was metalled for some distance. Drove Way 
        was less frequently used by this time, however, for the age of cycles 
        and cars had become popular.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">I recall in my youth a postman named <b>Haines</b> or 
        <b>Haynes </b>used to walk from Arborfield Hall to Carters Hill via Drove Way when 
        there were no letters to deliver in Church Lane which possessed only 3 
        houses. <b>Arthur Garrett</b> was Clerk to the Parish Council before me and he 
        knew more of the Rights of Way in Arborfield than anyone. The next 
        oldest Church to Arborfield old Church is, I believe at Hurst i.e. in 
        the vicinity of Carters Hill. No reasonably minded person would believe 
        that people from Carters Hill walked 3 miles to Hurst Church when Arborfield Old Church was within 1 
        mile by using Drove Way. Nor can 
        anyone believe that in those days permission to use Drove Way to get to 
        Church would have been refused.<br>
