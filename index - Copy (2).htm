<p class="tophead">A Potted History</p>
<p class="stbody">'<b>Arborfield</b>' is in fact two settlements;  much of what we know as '<b>Arborfield Cross</b>' was actually in the 
<b>Liberty of Newland</b>.</p>
<p class="stbody">The focal point is the Cross, which has been a crossroads for many centuries. It gained a new meaning in 1919 when the War Memorial was erected. 
Click <b><font size="2">
<a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1170168.HTML">here</a></font></b> 
for a stunning view of the Cross in winter, care of Reading Local Studies 
Library's on-line collection, and see what the cross-roads was like in 1927.&nbsp; 
During 2004, the <b>Memorial </b>was removed and repaired while the five-way junction 
was being re-shaped. Click <b><a href="memories_cross_nov04.htm">here</a></b> to 
see it as it was on Remembrance Sunday 2004.</p>
<p class="stbody">Celtic remains have been found at <b>
<a href="properties_Court.htm">Arborfield Court</a></b>, and Roman pottery was found when work started on the "Badgers' Mount" housing 
development; Roman coins have also been found  near the village centre, which is a couple of miles north of the "Devil's Highway" that linked London with Silchester.</p>
<p class="stbody">The medieval settlement of Arborfield by the <b>River Loddon</b> included a manor house and wooden church dating from Saxon times; both were later re-built, the 
<b><a href="church_old.htm">church</a></b> in the 13th Century in flint and chalk, the
<b><a href="properties_hall.htm">house</a></b> much later in 
1603 and again in 1842. A <b><a href="properties_mill.htm">mill</a></b> using power and water from the river produced high quality paper. 
These buildings are shown as they were in 1839 on the <b><a href="tithemap.htm">Tithe Apportionment map</a></b>.</p>
<p class="stbody">
<a href="tithemap.htm">
<img border="2" alt="Part of the Tithe Apportionment Map from 1839 showing the location of the old village" src  ="images/Tithe7_cropped.jpg" width=601 height=363 ></a></p>
<p class="stbody">By the 15th Century, a group of buildings had already been established at or near the crossroads, with the two Inns creating a centre for trade for the local farming community and travellers. Some of these old buildings are now in the Conservation Area. 
The <b><a href="properties_Pride_Map.htm">Thomas Pride Map of 1790</a></b>, 
which you can see in the <b>Reading Local Studies Library</b>, shows <b>
Arborfield Cross</b> and the old village of <b>Arborfield</b> by the <b>River 
Loddon</b>. It also shows that there used to be many more dwellings in <b>
'Newland'</b> close to the <b>Mole Brook</b>, between <b>Hughes Green</b> and <b>Bearwood</b>.</p>

<p class="stbody">The big growth came in the 20th Century when the <b>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Army_Remount_Service.htm">Remount Depot</a></b> was established to the south in Barkham. When it expanded into a garrison, the main entrance happened to be in Arborfield, and the name 
<b><a href="C20/memories_Army_Tech_School_1939.htm">'Arborfield Garrison'</a></b> stuck. Many residents have an Army background, moving into the village when they retired from military life. The 
<b>British Legion</b> has its County HQ here.</p>
<p class="stbody">The <b><a href="properties_motorways.htm">diversion of the M4</a></b> from its original planned route through south Oxfordshire had a profound effect on the village.  The new route passed south of Reading with junctions at Winnersh and Three Mile Cross, and large numbers of commuters 
now use Arborfield to get to and from the Motorway.&nbsp; They've had plenty of time to see the village as they waited to go through the crossroads. 
The <b><a href="properties_junction.htm">five-way junction</a></b> was reshaped as a large roundabout to cope with the 
growth.</p>
<p class="stbody">Over a century earlier, there was huge support for the 
proposed <b>
<a href="properties_railway.htm">Basingstoke - Wokingham Railway</a></b>, which 
the local paper described as&nbsp; <i>"a projected line, a little 
over 14 miles in length, which will probably do more than any other of a similar 
length in the South of England." </i><b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">&nbsp;</span></b>If 
it had been built, it would have passed right through what is now Arborfield 
Garrison, under a bridge at <b>Biggs Lane</b>, and then over another bridge at 
<b>Barkham 
Street</b>. However, in the event, the scheme never made it through Parliament.</p>
<p class="stbody">There's been a major change in the pattern of work. A century ago, over half of the residents were 'in service' while most of the rest were in agriculture. Many of the residents now work in the high-tech industries of the Thames Valley.</p>

<p class="stbody"> One project is to fill in gaps in data from the Parish 
Registers, which were stolen in the mid-1970's. The Marriage Register covered 
the period from 1837. Although we have been able to prepare a <b>marriage index</b> 
covering the entire period (available on the <b>data CD</b>), we don't have the 
depth of information that a marriage certificate would show. If you have inherited an ancestor's 
Marriage Certificate covering this period, or if you have any old copies of <b>
Parish Magazines</b> recording the event, please let us know so that we can 
transcribe the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
