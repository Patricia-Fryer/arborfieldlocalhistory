lived at <b>Barkham Rectory</b>, he had strong links with Arborfield, Newland and 
Barkham C.E. School, and took part in many events in Arborfield. During the

welfare of the soldiers at the <b><a href="../WW1/WW1_Barkham_Church.htm">

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not only in Berkshire, but 
throughout the country, deep regret will be felt that the <b>Rev. Peter Hampson 
Ditchfield</b>, F. S. A., for 44 years Rector of Barkham, and a man of 
distinguished literary gifts, president of the <b>Berkshire Archaeological 
Society</b>, passed away on Tuesday. He had been seriously ill for some weeks. 
Mr. Ditchfield's death is a great loss to Berkshire and the country as a whole.</p>

Lancashire Man</p>
</b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Mr, Ditchfield was a Lancashire man. The eldest son of Mr. Peter 
Ditchfield, of Westhoughton, he was born at Westhoughton on April 20th, 1854, 
and was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Clitheroe, and later at Oriel 
College, Oxford. In 1878, he was ordained, becoming a priest in the following 
year. His first appointment was to a curacy at Sandhurst, where he remained 
until 1880, when he went to Christ Church, Reading. Mr. Ditchfield held a curacy 
there for six years, and in 1886, was appointed Rector of Barkham, which office 
he had held since. Mrs. Ditchfield, to whom he was married in 1898, is a 
Berkshire lady, being a daughter of the late Mr. Charles H. Smith, of 
Ravenswood, Wokingham.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<b>
<p align="left">Scholastic Attainments</p>
</b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Mr. Ditchfield's scholastic attainments were notable. He held 
the following degrees and distinctions: B. A. (1877), M. A. (1881), F. S. A. 
(1882), French History Society (1894), F. R. S. L. (1900), Hon. A.R.I.B.A. 
(1920), and 2nd Class Math. Mod. (1873). </p>
<p align="left">He was organising secretary of the <b>Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel for Berks</b> from 1890 to 1907, and from 1886 to 1903 
he was <b>Diocesan Inspector of Schools</b>. </p>
<p align="left">Mr. Ditchfield enjoyed the distinction of being one of the <b>
Parliamentary Electors of the Universities</b>. He was prominently connected with the 
<b>Friends of the University 
of Reading</b>, and one of his last visits to Reading was on the occasion of the 
conferment of degrees at the University this summer.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">This year he also occupied the position of president of the <b>Old Clitheronians' Association</b>, an organisation connected with his old school in 
Lancashire.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<b>
<p align="left">His Literary Work</p>
</b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Mr. Ditchfield has occupied a distinguished place in the 
literary life of the country. He combined an easy, graceful style with a 
pleasant manner of imparting useful information, and many of his books have had 
a very great vogue. Mr. Ditchfield's literary works include: <br><br>"An Ecclesiastical 
History of Reading", 1883, <br>"Romance of Mathematics", 1886, <br>"Our English 
Villages", 1890, <br>"Old English Sports and Customs", 1900, <br>"The National Churches

and <br>"Country Folk", 1923. </p>
<p align="left">In addition, he was editor of the "Victoria County History of 
Berks", and general editor of the "Memorials of County History Series".</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<b>
<p align="left">Distinguished Mason</p>
</b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Mr. Ditchfield had been associated with the Masonic craft for a 
great many years, and had held high office. He was Grand Chaplain of the 
Freemasons of England in 1917 and of Mark Masons in 1918. He was a member of the 
Berkshire and the Authors’ Clubs.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">In September, 1928, when he celebrated his jubilee in the 
Ministry, the "Masonic News" wrote of him:-</p>
<p align="center">"He has enriched English Literature by upwards of 100 volumes, 
apart from his many valuable and interesting contributions to periodical 
publications, volumes and articles both having been chiefly on history, 
archaeology, topography, architecture, village and old country life and on 
London, although two would figure in catalogues under the head of ‘Fiction’. His 
first publishers were Methuen and Co. – Sir Algernon Methuen was a college 
friend – indeed, Methuen’s first published book, in 1883, was one written by 
Bro. Ditchfield, who has ever since published, though not exclusively, through 
that firm. He is responsible for the interesting weekly column on archaeology 
which appears in the ‘Reading Mercury’. He has lectured in several parts of 
England on ‘Shakespeare’s England’, ‘Old Village Life’; on ‘Fairs’, etc., at 
Reading, Bath, Warwick, Cambridge, Stafford, etc., while he has also found time 
for travel in France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, but particularly in his own 
country, of which he knows all parts, practically every nook and corner.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Keen Interest in Masonry</p></b>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">"It is really superfluous to tender to readers of the ‘Masonic 
News’ the information that Bro. Ditchfield has taken a keen interest in the 
craft of which he has been a distinguished member even from his initiation in 
1893 in the Downshire Lodge, 2437, at Wokingham, of which he was Master in 1901; 
he was one of the founders of the Heather Lodge, 3131, Wellington College, of 
which he was Master in 1913 and is now chaplain; also of the Berkshire Masters 
Lodge, 3684, of which he was Master in 1923, and of the Authors’ Lodge, 3456, 
his only Masonic tie outside Berkshire. He is an honorary member of the Berries 
Lodge, 2928; of the Victoria Lodge, 2671; and of the Ex Libria Lodge, 3765. He 
was [unreadable] honorary member of the Windsor Castle Lodge, 549; he was 
appointed P.P.G.W. of Berks and Oxon in 1906 and Grand Chaplain of England in 
1918. He was perfected in the Albert Victor Rose Croix Chapter, 117, Reading, in 
1923; joined the Grafton Chapter, 128, of which he is P.M.W.S., and, in 1927, 
was admitted to the 30<sup>th</sup> Degree. He has lectured on the History of 
Masonry to the Berkshire Masters, the Essex Masters, Fratres Calami Lodges, and 
has contributed articles to the ‘Transactions of the Authors’ Lodge’, the 
‘Masonic Secretaries’ Journal’, etc.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">"Combined with his great, unparalleled store of learning, Bro. 
Ditchfield has a charming personality and suavity of manner, always anxious to 
perform any act of kindness possible, that has endeared him not only to his own 
parishioners, but to his much wider circle of Masonic friends".</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<b>
<p align="left">Eminent Archaeologist</p>
<p align="left"></p>
</b>
<p align="left">His work as secretary of the Berkshire Archaeological Society 
was invaluable. For 38 years he held this post, and on the death of Mr. C. E. 
Keyser last year he was elected president of the society. He was editor of the 
"Berks, Bucks and Oxon Archaeological Journal" for 33 years up to the time of 
his death.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">He was the author of "Reading Pageant" [the Pageant was held in 
1920, and there was a long series of weekly articles on the Pageant], and 
collaborated with Dr. J. F. Read, who was organist at Christ Church during Mr. 
Ditchfield’s curacy there, in many notable musical productions.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<b>
<p align="left">A Jubilee Presentation</p>
</b>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">On New Year’s Day, 1928, the parishioners of Berkshire presented 
to their beloved rector an illuminated address to mark his completion of 50 
years in the Ministry, 42 of which had been spent at Barkham.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">The address stated: "To more than our generation of parishioners 
you have been both pastor and friend, your literary and archaeological 
achievements made your name known far beyond Barkham, and your writings have, in 
a rapidly changing age, done much to –people the past and save them from 
oblivion the memories of bygone days".</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Mr. G. Harris, the people’s warden, who presided at the 
presentation ceremony, said that just as the neighbouring village of Eversley 
had become famous from its association with the Rev. Charles Kingsley, so, he 
ventured to prophesy, Barkham would become famous for its association with the 
Rev. P. H. Ditchfield, and many people come to the village through having read 
his works.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">During Mr. Ditchfield’s incumbency at Barkham the old barrel 
organ was replaced by a more modern instrument, a new chancel was built, the 
church re-roofed, and a village hall built [this was on Barkham Street and was 
demolished in the 1980’s].</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Mr. Ditchfield never allowed himself much time for physical 
recreation, and his pastimes have been recorded in "Who’s Who" as "arranging 
meetings, correcting proofs and inspecting schools". He has played cricket, 
however, with the Gentlemen of Berkshire, Wokingham and other clubs, and he was 
fond of riding, appearing in the hunting field occasionally many years ago.</p>
