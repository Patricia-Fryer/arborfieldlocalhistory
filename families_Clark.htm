<font size="2">Thanks to Diane Maltby, Richard Allen and Alice Barbara Allen, we are now getting a 
glimpse of life in the ‘Swan’ in the early years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.
<p>
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="William Clark, standing in the porch at the 'Swan' in 1904, smoking a pipe" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/William_Clark_1904.jpg" width=150 height=271 ><b>William 
Clark</b> was landlord of the ‘Swan’ from around 1904 until his death in October 
1925. He’s buried in the churchyard in Arborfield. His widow <b>Betsy</b> lived 
in Shinfield for another quarter century, and is buried there. </p>
<p>Diane tells us that William was baptised on 26<sup>th</sup> July 1868 at 
Louth, Lincolnshire, the son of <b>James and Sarah Clark</b>. His father was 
described as a carrier and waggoner, so it was likely that William was around 
horses from an early age. The family ended up in Withern, near the east coast, 
before the 1881 census. </p>
<p>At some time before his marriage in 1891 he joined the Army. On 29th June 
1891 he married Withern girl <b>Betsy Carrott</b> at Baildon, Yorks, when he 
held the rank of sergeant in the 6th Dragoon Guards and was based at Leeds. When 
Diane’s grandfather Fred was born in York, 1902, William was a Farrier Major. He 
must have been posted regularly, because other children were born in Edinburgh, 
Preston and Aldershot.</p>
<p>There were at least 9 children, including <b>William</b>, <b>Tom</b> (who 
married a lady called May and lived locally), <b>Nellie</b> (who married Bert 
Dicker and also lived locally), <b>Fred</b>, <b>Edwin Guy</b> in 1905, <b>Jack</b> 
in 1907, <b>Thomas Victor</b> in 1910, and <b>Clifford James</b> (still living 
in Arborfield in <strong><a href="Census/electoral_roll_1950.htm">1950</a></strong>, according to the Electoral Register).</p>
<p><b>William junior</b> was born about 1893 in Edinburgh. He married to <b>
Alice</b>, and had two daughters. The family referred to him as 'the Colonel'. 
There’s a photo of William Clark junior in uniform as ‘Sergeant W. Clark, Royal 
Engineers, The Swan Inn, Arborfield Cross. - Mentioned in dispatches’. We’ve 
found his daughters <b>Alice Barbara</b>, baptised at Arborfield on 4<sup>th</sup> 
August 1918 when William was ‘C.Q.M.S. Royal Engineers’, and <b>Pamela</b>, 
baptised at Arborfield on 17<sup>th</sup> September 1922 even though the family 
then lived at The Cattle Market, Deptford where he was a Sarjeant R.C.O.S.</p>
<p>Diane’s grandfather <b>Fred Clark</b> married <b>Elsie Whittaker</b> and 
lived at Shinfield, Wokingham and Spencer's Wood. Fred used to say that his 
father was a very strict man, who had a horse whip at the dining table with 
which the children were threatened, at least, should they misbehave at 
mealtimes!</p>
<p>Some wonderfully clear photographs show the ‘Swan’ in 1904:<a href="pictures_swan_1904.htm"><img border="0" hspace="0" alt="The 'Swan' in 1904 with Willim Clark 5th from left" vspace="5" src="images/Thumb/Arborfield2_Swan.jpg" width="558" height="369"></a></p>

<p>We have a pen picture of William Clark from <b><a href="Memories_Street.htm">
Guy Bentley</a></b>: ‘the Swan Inn, Landlord Mr William Clark, a retired 
sergeant major and a very strict man who has retained his military bearing and 
discipline at all times. He has a very large garden, keeping several pigs in a 
big sty in the garden, and in the yard at the side of the inn there is stabling 
for several horses and also a large coach house. Mr Clark has no horses but the 
buildings are used to house poultry - hens, ducks and geese.’ </p>
