        <p class="stbody">The talking point of the village in late July 1931 
        must have been the fatal air crash at <b>Cross Lanes Farm</b> on 
        Saturday 18th at lunchtime; the <b><a href="properties_bull.htm">'Bull'
        </a></b>public house served as a short-term mortuary.</p>

        <p class="stbody">That year, the '<b>Reading Mercury</b>' was 
        interesting its readers in the novelty of flying, reporting on the 
        flying circus that visited Maidenhead and running competitions where the 
        prizes were free flights from nearby Woodley Aerodrome. In the midst of 
        this came the appalling crash reported below. The <b>Reading Mercury</b> 
        devoted many column inches to the crash and to the inquest which was 
        held during the following week. The articles are reproduced below in 
        full.&nbsp; The plane was a <b>Gipsy Moth</b> registered G-EBYK, similar 
        to the one which made a forced landing at Benson that autumn to refuel 
        at a new filling-station as shown here:</p>

        Expert Aviators Instantly Killed: Propeller and Engine Buried</font></span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">A shocking air tragedy – one of the 
        worst known in Berkshire – startled the inhabitants of Arborfield on 
        Saturday afternoon when, while trying to land, a private two-seater 
        aeroplane crashed into a field belonging to <b>Mr. C. W. Crocker, of 
        Cross Lanes Farm</b>. The woman pilot, who was well-known in Society, 
        and her passenger, a bank director, who was also an enthusiastic flyer, 
        were killed instantly; both receiving terrible injuries. The victims 
        were:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mrs. Violet Baring</b>, aged 
          31, of Earls Court Square, London, SW, a niece of Lady George Dundas, 
          of Newmarket, and also of the Marquess of Zetland, and</span></p>
          <li>
          <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mr. Philip Ernest Noble</b>, 
          aged 61, of Jesmond Road, Newcastle, and St. James’ Place, London W, a 
          former High Sheriff of Northumberland, a director of Lloyds Bank, and 
          a son of the late Sir Andrew Noble, the expert on explosives.</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The flyers were on their way to a 
        week-end party at Mr. Noble’s house, <b>Chisenbury Priory, Wilts.</b>, 
        and Mrs. Noble was awaiting their arrival. The machine left <b>Heston 
        (London) Aerodrome </b>at 12:30 p.m., less than half-an-hour before the 
        tragedy, the destination being <b>Upavon Aerodrome</b>. Mrs. Baring and 
        Mr. Noble were old friends, and had learned to fly at the same time, 
        about two years ago.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">CHANGE IN ORIGINAL PLANS.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Farm hands at work in Mr. Crocker’s 
        premises heard the engine of the ‘plane making an unusual noise, and 
        they saw it circling, gradually getting lower. Suddenly the nose of the 
        machine dropped and it dived to the ground behind a tall hedge. The 
        propeller and engine were buried about 2 ft. in the ground, the tail 
        being pointed almost straight up in the air. Petrol rushed out of the 
        shattered tank, but no fire followed, which was no doubt due, according 
        to witnesses, to the engine having been shut off immediately before the 
        ‘plane dived.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" alt="The shattered remains of the Gipsy Moth" src  ="images/G-EBYK_18_07_1931.jpg" width=644 height=224 ></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">INSTANT DEATH.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Those who rushed to the scene found 
        Mrs. Baring, who was occupying the rear cockpit seat, sitting strapped 
        in her seat, dead. The tail of the machine had to be pulled down before 
        she could be lifted out. Mr. Noble had been thrown forward onto the 
        engine, and parts of the machine had to be broken away in order to 
        extricate him. Beyond all doubt death must have occurred instantly. The 
        identity of Mrs. Baring was established by means of her pilot’s 
        certificate and an international motoring licence, which were found in a 
        pocket in the machine, but it was necessary to get in touch with the 
        aerodrome at Heston before the name of Mr. Noble could be found.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">With the house-party which had been 
        assembled at Chisenbury Priory, Mrs. Noble was awaiting her husband and 
        Mrs. Baring. As soon as the news of the accident reached her, Mrs. Noble 
        motored to Arborfield and identified her husband.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“It was simply an act of God that 
        Mrs. Baring and my husband should have been in the same machine 
        together”, she said. “The original plan was that Mr. Turner, a friend of 
        Mrs. Baring, should fly in her machine, and that my husband should fly 
        in his own machine. However, a fault was found in the petrol feed of Mr. 
        Noble’s aeroplane, and as he was anxious not to be late for lunch he 
        took Mr. Turner’s place in Mrs. Baring’s machine”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">OWNED TWO PLANES.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Noble was a most enthusiastic 
        pilot and about 18 months ago he had a remarkable escape from death when 
        flying at Heston, his machine crashing, but only bruises were received 
        be him. Mrs. Baring, who had also a great amount of flying experience, 
        had never been involved in an air accident. Besides having a ‘plane at 
        Heston, Mr. Noble kept another on in Northumberland. He was educated at 
        Eton and Oxford, and, in addition to his connection with Lloyds Bank, he 
        was a director of the National Bank of Scotland. In 1895 he married 
        Mabel, the second daughter of Percy Graham Buchanan Westmacott, formerly 
        of Rose Mount, Ascot, and had two sons and two daughters. Mrs. Baring 
        lived with her nine-year-old daughter. For some time no one had the 
        courage to break the news to the child, but at last she had to be told. 
        Mrs. Barings’ housekeeper said that after she had explained as gently as 
        she could that the girl’s mother was dead, the child would not leave her 
        and followed her about pathetically asking for more details.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The bodies were first taken to <b>
        The Bull at Arborfield</b>. The same evening they were removed to the 
        private mortuary of <b>Messrs. Heelas at Wokingham.</b></span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">INQUEST OPENED.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">EVERYTHING IN ORDER BEFORE 
        MACHINE LEFT.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The inquest was opened by the 
        Reading Divisional Coroner (<b>Mr. R. S. Payne</b>) at Wokingham town 
        Hall on Monday, when only evidence of identification and medical 
        testimony was taken. <b>Major Cooper</b>, the inspector-general of 
        accidents to the Air Ministry, sat with the coroner, and the relatives 
        of Mrs. Baring were represented by <b>Mr. Norman Matthews</b> 
        (solicitor). </span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In answer to the coroner, the jury 
        intimated that they did not wish to see the bodies.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“I am here to help you in any way”, 
        Major Cooper told the coroner. “I could give evidence up to a point”, he 
        added. “My duty is to make an inquiry and report to the Secretary of 
        State for Air”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">EXPERT FLYERS.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner remarked that they were 
        fortunate in having the assistance of Major Cooper. “Obviously there has 
        not been time to investigate all the circumstances”, said the coroner, 
        “and an adjournment will be necessary. The only evidence of the 
        occurrence is that of people in the neighbourhood, but at the adjourned 
        hearing we can have technical evidence from people at the aerodrome from 
        which the ‘plane started. Both the people who had lost their lives were 
        expert flyers, holding flying certificates, and apparently they had done 
        a great deal of flying, but whether in this machine or not I do not 
        know”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Evidence for the identity of Mr. 
        Noble was given by his wife, <b>Mrs. Mabel Noble</b>, who was dressed in 
        deep mourning. She said she lived at Chisenbury Priory, Wilts., and her 
        husband had been accustomed to pilot aeroplanes, having held a pilot’s 
        certificate for over two years. She last saw her husband about a 
        fortnight ago, and had expected him to come to Marlborough by air on 
        Saturday.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In answer to Mr. Matthews, Mrs. 
        Noble said that it was only since the accident that she had learned that 
        her husband had just completed negotiations with Mrs. Baring for the 
        purchase of her machine. Mrs. Baring was going to stay at Marlborough, 
        and a week-end party had been arranged, Mrs. Barings’ room having 
        already been prepared.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">When Mrs. Noble had concluded her 
        evidence, <b>Councillor F. S. Perkins</b> (who was the foreman of the 
        jury) expressed the jury’s sympathy with her. “I thank you very, very 
        deeply”, she replied.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">FIANCE’S EVIDENCE</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The next witness was <b>Mr. John 
        Denis Turner</b>, of 8, John Street, Mayfair, and he said he identified 
        the body of Mrs. Baring. </span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner: Was she divorced? – 
        Yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Matthews: She divorced her 
        husband.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Supt. Goddard</b>: There is a 
        difference.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner: What was his name?</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“Richard”, replied Mr. Turner, who 
        continued that Mrs. Baring lived at Earls Court Square.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner: She had a flying 
        certificate for all purposes? – Yes, an “A” licence.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Major Cooper: That is generally 
        called a pilot’s licence.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Turner said that he saw Mrs. 
        Baring leave Heston Aerodrome in a De Havilland “Moth” two-seater 
        machine. Mr. Noble was her passenger, and there was no doubt that she 
        was the pilot, the controls for his seat having been disconnected. The 
        destination of the machine was Upavon Aerodrome.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner: Did she seem in good 
        health and spirits on leaving? – Yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Did she start all right? – Yes; 
        there was an excellent take-off.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">I understand this machine had just 
        been purchased from Mrs. Baring. Was it a new machine? – No; it was 
        built in 1930. </span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">She was quite used to flying it? – 
        Yes, she had been flying it the week-end before.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Was the weather all right for 
        flying? – Yes, the weather was perfectly normal.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">A CAREFUL PILOT.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The certificate of airworthiness of 
        the machine had been renewed last September, continued witness. It would 
        take about half-an-hour to get to Wokingham from Heston. The machine was 
        one commonly used by two people.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Major Cooper: It was licensed to 
        carry two.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Matthews: You have flown with 
        Mrs. Baring on several occasions? – Yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In fact you were engaged to be 
        married to her? – Yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Would you describe her as a careful 
        pilot? – Yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Major Cooper said he would like to 
        put certain questions to Mr. Turner, and on receiving the coroner’s 
        permission asked: Did the pilot say anything to you about breaking her 
        journey in order to land at Woodley, near Reading, or anywhere else? 
        Witness: No.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">She knew Woodley Aerodrome quite 
        well? – Yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Woodley is quite near, and she 
        would have no difficulty in seeing it? – That is so.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Was any luggage carried? – Two 
        suitcases in the back locker.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“The position in which luggage is 
        carried is of importance”, remarked Major Cooper.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Dr. E. F. Smith</b>, the 
        Wokingham police surgeon, said he went to the scene of the crash at 1:10 
        p.m., and when he arrived Mr. Noble’s body was being extricated from the 
        wreckage. The injuries were very extensive, the cause being head 
        injuries received by coming into contact with the windscreen.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The doctor was describing the 
        numerous injuries, when the coroner intervened, remarking, “I do not 
        think it is necessary for the doctor to go into details. Mr. Noble was 
        practically smashed to bits”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">NO QUESTION OF HEART ATTACK.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Smith said he considered that 
        Mrs. Baring was killed instantly owing to the injuries she had received 
        to her head.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">On my order you made a post mortem 
        examination? – yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Did you find anything which might 
        make her lose control? – No.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Her heart and lungs were normal? 
        Yes; there was no question of a heart attack.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The doctor added that when the 
        crash occurred Mrs. Baring’s head struck the back of Mr. Noble’s seat.
        </span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“Was Mrs. Baring wearing suitable 
        flying clothes?” inquired Major Cooper.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“Yes, she was wearing a flying 
        suit”, replied Dr. Smith.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Major Cooper: Nothing in the way of 
        a skirt which would have fouled the controls? – No.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner enquired when a 
        resumption of the enquiry would be convenient, and Major Cooper said a 
        short adjournment would be preferable.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“There is a certain amount of 
        satisfaction in knowing that death came instantly and that no pain 
        occurred”, said the coroner, “but what the sensation was immediately 
        before the crash I would not like to say”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">INQUIRY BY AIR MINISTRY.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In answer to enquiries as to the 
        nature of the evidence to be called at the adjourned hearing, Supt. 
        Goddard said that evidence would be called from the aerodrome to say 
        that everything was in order before the machine left the ground. “We 
        cannot go into the suitability of the machine; the Air Ministry will do 
        that”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner adjourned the enquiry

        Verdict of Accidental Death</font></span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The inquest on the two victims of 
        the flying accident at Arborfield on Saturday was concluded yesterday at 
        Wokingham by the Coroner (Mr. R. S. Payne).</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>John Joseph Parkes</b>, a sales 
        manager, of Heston Aerodrome, said he tested the machine two days before 
        the fatality and found it in perfect order.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Asked why a parachute was not 
        carried, he said parachutes were expensive and really unnecessary for 
        private aircraft, which were not likely to break up in the air. With 
        Service machines the conditions were different. A parachute was not of 
        much use below 1,500 feet.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mrs. Phyllis Windsor, of 
        Swallowfield Road</b>, Arborfield, who saw the crash, said the machine 
        was about to make an easy landing, when it suddenly nose-dived to the 
        earth.</span></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">MRS. BARING FAINTED.</span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Captain Valentine Henry Baker</b>, 
        chief instructor at Heston Aerodrome, said he was with the machine when 
        the engine was started and it ran perfectly. The take-off was a careful 
        one.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner: You actually taught 
        Mrs. Baring? – Yes, in September 1929. She flew solo after 12 hours’ 
        instruction. She was a very careful pilot and often came back for 
        further instruction. I last flew with her in June of this year.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Asked by the Coroner if he had 
        formed any theory how the crash happened, he replied: “I have seen the 
        machine and in my considered opinion Mrs. Baring fainted or at least 
        felt very ill and at the last moment she pushed the control stick 
        forward to prevent ‘stalling’. That would have the effect of pushing the 
        machine straight into the ground. It is not possible with this type of 
        machine, fitted with safety slots, for the machine to dive into the 
        ground in the position it did from an accidental stall. Since the crash 
        I have carried out experiments with a similar type of machine with a 
        view to seeing if it would dive into the ground in a similar position, 
        and it can’t be done accidentally”.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">“I think she felt ill and intended 
        to land. If she had left the controls alone the machine would have come 
        down and been smashed up, but no-one would have been hurt. She was a 
        very good pilot, and her instinct, if she felt ill, would be to push the 
        stick forward.”</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Major P. P. Cooper, 
        Inspector-General of Accidents to the Air Ministry, said he had 
        inspected the machine and he was satisfied no main part of the machine 
        had broken. The engine was not running when the crash occurred and the 
        nose of the machine had struck the ground almost at right angles. There 
        had been petrol in the tanks and the machine was not therefore 
        endeavouring to land from petrol shortage. The engine had been examined 
        and no defect had been found which would have caused the crash.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The jury returned a verdict of 
        “Accidental death” in each case, and they added a rider that a 
        recommendation should be forwarded to the proper quarter that parachutes 
        or similar appliances for escape, should be carried in all types of 
        civil aircraft. Had parachutes been carried in this case they thought 
        that two valuable lives would have been saved.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The coroner said he would forward 
        the jury’s recommendations to the Director of Civil Aviation.</span></p>
