  <p class="stbody">
        The pedestrian who asks for the church at Arborfield, in Berkshire, 
        will, without a doubt, be asked in return if he means the new one. If an 
        antiquarian, his reply will be in the negative, and thereupon he will be 
        told that by keeping straight through the Park Drive at Arborfield Hall 
        until he comes to a white gate he will see the “ old ‘un.”</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        It was a sultry afternoon in late May; there was a distant grumbling of 
        thunder, the clouds were low and leaden, and there had already been 
        several heavy showers, as I followed the directions and came upon the 
        ruined church of St. Bartholomew, at Arborfield, all suddenly, by the 
        white gate.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The first view of the structure is singularly impressive. There is about 
        the hallowed spot an atmosphere of departed times and customs, of an age 
        when hustle was an unknown word. Em-bosomed in a thick, interlaced bower of yew, holly, pine, honeysuckle 
        and tangled growth, the remains of this once
        unassuming 13th century church present a scene of crumbling beauty that 
        it would be difficult to match within a hundred miles.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        I passed up the clean path and stood looking at a bold gable wall, 
        spectral and gaunt, which rears its ivy-clad head aloft in the air, and 
        is buttressed by late 17th or early 18th century brickwork. A large 
        window, the tracery and glass of which have vanished, has a shallow 
        splay and its renovation in thin brick, while some pink colouring is 
        still to be seen on the facing of the splay.  </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The window and core of the 
        wall are distinctly suggestive of Transitional Norman work, while the 
        restoration has been effected as though the window were pure Norman with 
        the rounded arch. The erection has in many particulars suffered cruelly 
        at the hands of inexperienced restorers at different periods of its 
        existence. In several places, where the rough cast has fallen away, are 
        traces of red brick, especially where the quoins are missing, but 
        possibly may be lying somewhere about the nave or churchyard.  </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        I passed 
        along and entered a doorway into what I took to be the nave. No “dim 
        religious light” reigned in the sacred spot where hymn and chant had 
        once ascended into an old timber roof of hoary tradition. But it was an 
        unique scene, and quaintly suggestive of, and full and overflowing with 
        the natural handwork of God and the sweet picturesqueness which the 
        dilapidation of religious edifices imparts. A thick wall of flint and 
        chalk rubble of early character bounded my left, while on my right was a 
        small chapel, restored. The central walk of the nave was formed of large 
        square red tiles, uneven and worn. Beneath my feet were tombstones, 
        scarred and scratched, and the rain pattered down upon them from God’s 
        roof above. T’was all open to the sky. The winds entered not and 
        vegetation thrived in luxurious profusion. Ivy hugged the walls and 
        crept along the ground.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        I turned about. Three steps of brick led up to what was once an altar. 
        It is the altar still, for it has been dedicated to the Lord, and the 
        presence of a blackbird’s nest with five young in it, is assuredly a fit 
        emblem of the purity and sacredness of the spot. Here, not a century 
        ago, simple villagers had knelt and pledged their truest vows, many of 
        which they doubtless broke, as mere humans do. From here the voice of 
        one who lay in silent dust beneath my feet had called forth Heaven’s 
        blessing on all his flock.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        There is a piscina in the altar wall, and on the floor are two small 
        tablets to the Hodgkinsons, Rectors of the parish, and the wife of one 
        of them, who died in the second year of her marriage:-</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <i><b>“A sigh the absent claims, the dead a tear;<br>
        Forgive the wish that would have kept you here.”</b></i></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        There was a heavy scent of rain-washed vegetation in the air, an almost 
        overpowering odour of succulent stems and exotic growth. The bees droned 
        in the buds near the altar and a few young rooks looked on and cawed 
        noisily from a neighbouring yew as I bent to take the following 
        inscription on a tomb in the nave;-<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>Here lyeth the body of Thomas Haward, Gent, wth Anne his wyfe and 
        Frances there onely child who was married to William Thorold, Esqr., and 
        had issue 7 sones and 7 daughters. This Thomas Haward depted y 24th of 
        November, Ao.dni 1643.</b></i><br>
        <br>
        Hard by there is a rough coffin-shaped stone, apparently a very old 
        monument. There is no inscription upon it, but it may be to the memory 
        of a member of the Bullock family, who held the estate in very early 
        times and one of whom is referred to as “Hugh with the Brazen Hand”.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        I moved along curiously alert for discoveries. Of tower or porch there 
        is no trace, although it is recorded that at the west end there was a 
        tower carried on four wooden posts, and containing five bells which were 
        removed to the new church built in 1863. There are two or three stone 
        corbels in the walls at the western end of the nave, and sockets in the 
        other walls suggest the removal of similar details. Where the 
        congregation once sat there is a garden of lush grass, and the noble 
        “cuckoo-pint” springs with its convolute head from the surrounding 
        luxuriant growth. Here also young sycamore, nettles, hedge parsley, and 
        the deadly solanum flourish in the floor dedicated to the Most High. 
        Beneath this “garden” maybe lie the remains of lordly knights and ladies 
        fair, who once attended to hear their pastor deliver his perorations on 
        the virtues of his patrons. And now “Lords and ladies” above and lords 
        and ladies below; a natural growth and inanimate recollections!</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Conjuring, I passed along. A new looking porch attracted attention near 
        the middle of the nave. I found a modern and unsuitable iron gate closed 
        and locked, but peering within the porch I saw an ancient wooden door, 
        with heavy iron-winged hinges and a doorway of a very plain order, 
        probably transitional Norman. I remember, however, that it had a 
        chamfered impost, and above the doorway an oaken beam, whitewashes, had 
        painted upon it the date 1631. Some additions were probably made to the 
        church at this time. Above this again was chalk tablet with a carved 
        escutcheon. I climbed the gate, pushed open the old oaken door and 
        entered the chapel.  </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        A rumble of thunder from the heavens greeted my 
        entrance. It was dark, very dark, and an odour of age and forgotten 
        greatness seemed to impregnate this shrine of the dead. The floor was 
        heaped with plaster from the ceiling, and looking up I saw that the 
        laths were showing in places. In parts the walls are cracked and 
        fissured and the creeping ivy has made its way into the interstices, 
        while a huge crack runs from one of the tiny, long and narrow splayed 
        lancets to the roof, suggesting a difficult problem to the restorer. if 
        he ever comes. Around the walls are many mural tablets of marble to the 
        Conroy family, and opposite the doorway a fine escutcheon carved in 
        chalk. An oak-panelled dado runs round the chapel, save where a portion 
        has been wrenched away. The altar rails are intact. The little gate 
        leading to the altar - the Table is gone - was open and the floor beneath a 
        mass of dust and plaster. I gazed around conscious of the instability of 
        earthly things and the lesson which this little rural chapel imparts to 
        all those who stand within its walls. Facing the altar is a three-light 
        window of the Perpendicular style, with coloured glass and an 
        inscription beneath the two central figures. My eyes had now become used 
        to the light within this small shrine so reminiscent of manor lords, and 
        over the door which I had entered I made out the following inscription, 
        which, if it should be inaccurate in any small particular, is the fault 
        of the darkness of the thunderstorm and of the lack of light in the 
        chapel:-<br>
        <br>
        This part of the freehold aisle formerly attached to the old church of 
        Arborfield (and which was finally taken down in February1869), was 
        rebuilt and enlarged by proper authority by Sir Edward Conroy, Bart., 
        not only to preserve the tablets and records of his family, but also as 
        a tribute of love and respect for the memories of his nearest relations, 
        who were the only members for centuries buried out of Ireland.<br>
        <br>
        I was unable to gain admittance into the other portion of this aisle, 
        but I find that it is in the possession of the Hargreaves family and 
        contains tombs to the Standens, including a very fine one to Sir William 
        Standen, 1639. The Standens were the squires of Arborfield in the 17th 
        and part of the 18th century, and it is the last of the family, Edward, 
        who figures as the luckless swain in Gay’s ballad, “Molly Mogg”. He died 
        a bachelor in 1730, and there is a tomb to his memory.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The churchyard is a sweet old place of tall grass, sorrel, and cleanly 
        swept paths. There is in places a spongy floor of pine needles, while 
        some of the inscriptions of the table tombs are clothed in a similar 
        covering. Over the innumerable mounds dotted round the church, the 
        primrose and violet cluster in delightful profusion, and the ivy hugs 
        wooden memorials of the later Georgian day, whose supports are decaying 
        and worm-ridden. A low brick wall of apparently early 18th century 
        construction marks the boundary of the “acre”, and several old family 
        vaults are surrounded by the familiar urn and spike railings. Near by an 
        old doorway and beneath the shade of two slender yews, is a wooden 
        monument to the memory of Thomas Appleby, who died in 1851, and was 
        Parish Clerk for 33 years.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        From the corner of the churchyard a little gate leads into the grounds 
        of Arborfield Hall, a modern Manor House built on the site of the old 
        one in 1832. Miss Mitford describes its predecessor in “Our Village” as 
        “the old house of Aberleigh.”<br>
