<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Resident Governor, <b>Captain H. W.

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Committed from Wokingham Police Court 
  in July, <b>George Edward Tune</b>, former secretary of the Royal Merchant 
  Navy School, Bearwood, was on Wednesday sentenced to 4 years’ hard labour by 
  Judge MacClure, at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey. The accused after 
  hearing his sentence, gave notice of appeal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The case, which has attracted 
considerable interest in the district, was first heard at a special Wokingham 
Court on July 29<sup>th</sup>, when the case was committed to the Central 
Criminal Court. The defendant reserving his defence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>CONVERTED £500 TO OWN USE:</b> Tune, 
a former secretary of the Royal Merchant Navy School, was charged with three 
offences of converting subscriptions belonging to the Royal Merchant Navy School 
Pension Fund to his own use. The sum involved was £568 - £312 having been 
withdrawn in cash from the P.O. account, and £256 by crossed warrant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was alleged that this, together with 
Tune’s own money – a large sum of which he had borrowed – was spent on a <b>Mrs. 
Wallace</b>, whom he met in 1940. The hearing in London lasted for three days, 
before a jury of five men and two women; the counsel for the prosecution was Mr. 
S. H. Noakes, the defending counsel, Mr. B. Stirling.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>SPENT LARGE SUM ON CHILDREN’S 
CLOTHING, ETC.:</b> Tune pleaded in his defence that he had spent a large sum of 
money on children’s clothing, shorts and stockings, etc., and had given wrist 
watches to boys leaving the school. He asserted that he also bought carpets and 
various articles of furniture for the school. In cross-examination he claimed 
that the clothing had been bought from Jackson’s of Reading, also Selfridges and 
Harrods. The furniture had been bought second-hand, and no receipts for the 
transactions were received.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This money, Tune claimed, had been 
expended in the interests of the school, and that he had never used one penny 
piece – directly or indirectly – for his own personal use. He further stated 
that he had made these purchases without the knowledge or sanction of the Board 
as he knew that they would possibly have considered it extravagant. Continuing, 
he said that he had spent the money out of his own pocket, and had also borrowed 
a sum of money from two people who had since died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>RECEIVED £250 FOR FINDING MAN A HOUSE 
IN WOKINGHAM:</b> He also said that he had received £250 from a man for finding 
him a house in the Wokingham district. He had kept records of the money he had 
spent on clothes and furniture, etc., on pieces of paper. In answer to further 
questions, he said that there would be about 100 sheets which had been filed in 
his office.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>“WOULD HAVE PROVED MY DEFENCE”:</b> 
“These papers”, asserted Tune, “would have proved my defence but they were 
removed from my office by someone during the time I was suspended. I was not 
allowed to go into the office unless I brought a friend and that a member of the 
Board was present”. Speaking of his own financial position, Tune said that he 
had received a salary of £500 per annum from the school, and he was in receipt 
of an army pension of £63 per annum, and that he had received more than £150 
from publishers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On his friendship with Mrs. Wallace, 
Tune said that it was purely platonic and that he only tried to help her get out 
of her debt to Harvey Nichols Ltd. Tune claimed that when he took up the 
appointment at the school in 1939, it had an overdraft of £6,000, but that when 
he was dismissed, the invested capital of the school was £28,000. After being 
questioned on this point, Judge MacClure opined that there was no doubt that the 
war was responsible to some extent for the change of balance, and the public’s 
appreciation of the wok of the Merchant Navy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>HOUSE AT SINDLESHAM:</b> Mr. Noakes 
(prosecuting) questioned Tune about a house at <b>Carter’s Hill, Sindlesham</b>, 
where Mrs. Wallace resided. Tune replied that he had paid the rent of £25. It 
was subsequently proved by the production of two cheques that he had paid over 
£60 in two months. This was later admitted by Tune. In consequence of further 
cross-examination, and questions by Judge MacClure, it was suggested that Tune 
had spent £1,500 on Mrs. Wallace. This was not disputed by the accused.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mrs. Carlton Wallace</b> stated that 
Tune was a friend of hers, and her husband. She had met Tune in 1940, and after 
they became known to each other, she told him that she owed Harvey Nichols £400. 
Subsequently she discovered that someone had paid £300 off of her account. [sic]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>MINK COAT £198:</b> Questioned by 
Judge MacClure, “I think you also received a mink coat valued at £198.9.0.”, 
witness replied “Yes, my Lord.” Cross-examined, she agreed that she had received 
a writ from a Reading firm, and that Tune had given her the money in cash.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Mrs. M. Nash</b>, of Woodley, a 
former assistant to Tune at the school, stated that she was, for a time, his 
private secretary. In answer to questions put to her by Mr. Noakes, she said 
that there was a letter book, kept in the office, in which he recorded a précis 
of letters received. This could not now be found, but was in existence at the 
time she was employed at the school. In response to further questioning, she 
asserted that the papers which Tune had claimed contained details of purchases 
were filed with letters in the office, but that they would take a longer time to 
find, as the index to them was in the letter book. She further stated that the 
office had been entered during the week that Tune was suspended, by the 
Headmaster, and by a female member of staff.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>“THIS MAN A HUMBUG”:</b> In stating 
the case for the prosecution, Mr. Noakes addressed the jury by saying “This man 
is a humbug; he is trying to pull the wool over your eyes. There was never a 
simpler case of fraudulent conversion”. Judge MacClure’s summing up took two 
hours, and the jury decided their verdict without retiring, within two minutes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Judge MacClure, in passing sentence 
said, “This is a very serious case. We owe a great deal of gratitude to the 
Merchant Navy, and this man broke his trust.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During his address to the jury, Counsel 
for the defence (Mr. B. Stirling) paid a warm compliment to <b>Det. Sgt. 
Chrisptoher</b>, of the Wokingham Police, for the very fair and impartial way in 
which he gave evidence.</span></p>
