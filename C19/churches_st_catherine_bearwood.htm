The <b>Walter</b> family not only set up <b>Bearwood Mansion</b>, but also 
created a model village at <b>Sindlesham</b>, plus a new ecclesiastical parish 
of <b>St. Catherine’s, Bearwood</b>. A new church was built on the north of 
Bearwood Road opposite the Mansion. The parish consisted of the <b>Liberty of 
Newland</b>, <b>Sindlesham</b>, parts of <b>Winnersh</b> and land alongside <b>
Bearwood Road</b>.<p><a href="../C20/families_arthur_walter.htm">
<img border="0" alt="St. Catherine's Church, Bearwood; in the foreground is a memorial to Arthur Walter, died 1910" src  ="../images/new/St_Catherines_Bearwood.jpg" width=637 height=476 ></a><b><a href="../families_john_walter_2.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Walter family memorial in Bearwood churchyard, with John Walter II at the head" vspace    =5 align=right src="../images/new/Walter_memorial.jpg" width=439 height=331 ></a></b></p>
<p>The large grave shown on the right is the memorial for the family of <b>
<a href="../families_john_walter_2.htm">John Walter II</a></b> of <b>Bearwood 
Mansion</b>, who died in 1847.</p>
<p>The Parish Registers are lodged with <b>Berkshire Record 
Office</b> and have been transcribed and indexed. As of 2009, the following 
Registers are available:</p>
<p><b>Baptisms, 1846 – 1949;</b></p>
<p><b>Marriages, 1846 – 1979;</b></p>
<p><b>Burials, 1846 – 1929; </b></p>
<p><b>Banns of Marriage, 1851 – 1980</b>.</p>
<p>As far as the <b>Liberty of Newland</b> was concerned, to what extent did its 
inhabitants use the new parish church? Those living at <b>Arborfield Cross</b> 
had the choice of a mile’s walk to St. Bartholomew’s at Lower Arborfield, or two 
miles’ walk to St. Catherine’s, Bearwood. It is clear from St. Bartholomew’s 
parish registers that most of those at Arborfield Cross regarded Arborfield as 
‘their’ parish, but to start with, a few Arborfield Cross families attended St. 
Catherine’s. </p>
<p>The St. Catherine’s Parish Registers can be a bit vague about location, so it can be 
difficult to work out just who was from the Liberty of Newland. <b>‘Bearwood’</b> 
and <b>‘Sindlesham’</b> not only encompassed the communities around the green at 
Sindlesha<a href="../families_simonds_john3.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Caleb Jeacocke (left) and John Simonds (right) at the front door of 'Poplars'" vspace   =5 align=right src="../images/new/Jeacocke2.jpg" width=315 height=385 ></a>m, but also as far as the 
<b><a href="../A_N_1947_12b.htm">Mole Brook</a></b> on the road to Arborfield Cross 
where the <b>Jeacocke</b> family lived for many years. </p>
<p>[The photo on the right shows <b>Caleb Jeacocke</b> outside his home, and his 
master <b><a href="../families_simonds_john3.htm">John Simonds III</a></b>.]</p>
<p>In the early 1860s the mediaeval <b>St. Bartholomew’s church</b> was replaced 
by a new Victorian building far closer to Arborfield Cross, and it seems that 
from this time, more and more Arborfield Cross folk were baptised, married and 
buried there rather than in Bearwood. The <b><a href="../families_simonds.htm">Simonds family</a></b> of Newlands had long 
been associated with St. Bartholomew’s; not only did the Rector’s daughter <b>Ellen 
Hayes</b> marry <b>John Simonds III</b>, but John’s sister <b>Mary</b> married the Curate, 
<b>Rev. 
Wyndham C. H. Hughes D'Aeth</b>, in 1866. The curate’s family lived at Arborfield 
Cross for some years afterwards. </p>
<p>A century later, in the 1960s, the ecclesiastical boundaries were quite 
anachronistic, and the then Rector of St. Bartholomew’s, <b>Geoffrey Carr</b>, was 
energetic in welcoming new residents of Arborfield Cross and encouraging them to 
attend his parish church. Finally, the benefices of Arborfield and Barkham were 
united under a new Rector in 1977, and the Church of England re-drew the 
boundaries in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in family history in Arborfield and Newland should consult 
the <b>St. Catherine’s Parish Registers</b> as well as St. Bartholomew’s. Just to give 
an idea of what they may find, here is a <b>small selection</b> of Baptisms, Marriages 
and Burials of local inhabitants. </p>

<b>Charles and Sarah Simonds</b> in 1841. <b>Ann Jeacock</b>, aged 55, also lived at Newland 
House; was she his mother? Caleb married <b>Ann Chapman</b> on October 19<sup>th</sup> 
1848 at St. John the Baptist, Shoreditch, and by 1851 he and Ann, with their 
2-year-old daughter Mary Ann, were at ‘Poplars’ by the Mole Brook on Sindlesham 
Road, where they lived for many years. Caleb was Enumerator for the Census for 
several decades, and in later years his son <b>John</b> and daughter <b>Avice</b> carried on 
this duty. By 1891, 84-year-old Caleb was described as a ‘Farm Steward’ rather 
than a Bailiff. A <b>‘Miss Jeacocke’ </b>was the organist at St. Catherine’s for many 
years, playing at the funeral of <b><a href="../families_john_walter_3.htm">John Walter III</a></b> in 1894 and of
