First Year</a></font></span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The first year established the pattern 
for the future.&nbsp; Minutes record that the first "parish meeting of the parochial 
electors of the Liberty of Newland" was held at the Reading Room in Church Lane 
on 4th December 1894 "(by the kind permission of Mrs Hargreaves of Arborfield 
Hall)",&nbsp; at what we would consider was a very early time of 6.30 pm.&nbsp; At this 
meeting,&nbsp; 18 Parochial Electors chose 5 men for the council,&nbsp; and these were 
listed as:&nbsp; George Kennard, Arthur Charles Tayler, Elias Trowbridge, William 
Vincent and John Simonds Esq. The Reading Room&nbsp; (now Reading Room Cottage)&nbsp; was 
without gas or electricity, and it is recorded that&nbsp; "2 shillings was paid to 
the caretaker for lighting fire &amp; lamps,&nbsp;cleaning room,&nbsp; etc.".&nbsp; </span></p>
<font size="2">
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The first actual Parish Council was 
held 2 weeks later on 15th December in the School room at Newland's,&nbsp; the home 
of John Simonds,&nbsp; at the slightly later time of 7 pm.&nbsp; John Simonds was 
unanimously elected Chairman,&nbsp; a post he held until his death in 1929&nbsp; when his 
son John Hayes Simonds was elected in his stead. George Garrett,&nbsp; the 
assistant overseer, was appointed Clerk. (John Simonds and Elias Trowbridge were 
Overseers&nbsp; -&nbsp; posts that pre-dated the Parish Council),&nbsp; The first real Council 
decision was&nbsp; "to issue a precept,&nbsp; from time to time,&nbsp; on the Overseers for 
payment of any moneys which may become payable, without at the present time 
appointing a Treasurer.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Many of the meetings were dominated by 
the <b>"Fuel Allotments, or Coal Charity"</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The income was £2.13.10 per quarter or 
a total of £10.15.4 per annum.&nbsp; It was decided that&nbsp; "no one should be entitled 
to receive the coal who had not resided in the parish one year."&nbsp;  George 
Kennard and  Elias Trowbridge were left to report on the different families in 
the parish at a meeting on Dec 20th at Newlands at 6.30 pm.&nbsp; Finally, the clerk 
was instructed to&nbsp; "ask Mr Wells to cart 3 loads of gravel to repair the 
footpath at the back of Mr Trowbridge's".</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The first annual Parish Meeting was 
held in the Arborfield and Barkham School room on Monday April 1st 1895 at 6.30 
pm.&nbsp; The minutes report that "The adoptive acts were discussed but no 
proposition was made."&nbsp; The School, built in 1873 and provided with gas 
lighting, was subsequently used for all public meetings and most Council 
meetings&nbsp; (except some that were held in the comfort of Newlands,&nbsp; or of Newland 
Farm House - particularly in the Second World War when the School had no 
facilities for blacking-out).&nbsp; The caretaker, Mrs Emblen,&nbsp; was paid up to two 
shillings&nbsp; to light fires, etc.&nbsp; At that time,&nbsp; the school building was very 
small;&nbsp; the frontage was doubled in 1910&nbsp; (the slightly different brickwork is 
still noticeable). Apart from a few cottages towards the Cross,&nbsp; the school was 
set apart from the main centre of population.</span></p>

      >The Parish Councillors then met a week later on 
      Tuesday 9th April at 7 pm. Among the business was a cheque drawn in 
      payment for 11 tons 5 cwt (hundredweight) of Cannock coal in lots of 9 
      cwt. to Messrs C &amp; J Ayres of Reading.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >The Annual Meeting of the Parish Council&nbsp; was 
      held a week after this on Tuesday 16th April at 7 pm.&nbsp; After 
      this,&nbsp; there was no recorded activity until December 4th 1895 at 6.30 
      pm.&nbsp; The Clerk was requested to obtain the price of good Cannock 
      Cobble coals from 3 suppliers - Ayres,&nbsp; Whatley Bros. of Reading and 
      Gadd &amp; Co of Wokingham.&nbsp; Also to enquire if the Churchwardens of 
      Arborfield had the inclosure award documents for the Liberty of Newland in 
      their possession&nbsp; (no,&nbsp; it later transpired that they 
      didn't).&nbsp; The Clerk informed the Council that a bond of 2 sureties 
      for £50 had been duly executed and forwarded to the District Council at 
      Wokingham for the performance of his office as Assistant 
      Overseer.</span></p>

      >In 1895, 26 families were listed to receive coal (the 
      extra name was James Falconer),&nbsp; and the practice was for the names 
      for the previous year to be posted on the Church door.&nbsp; By 1896, 
      there were 23 recipients,&nbsp; followed by 22 in 1897 and 1898,&nbsp; 24 
      in 1899 including for the first time a "W Stacey",&nbsp; who lived "Near 
      the Mole Inn".&nbsp; Descendents of this family eventually moved into 
      Emblen Crescent.&nbsp; At its peak in 1906,&nbsp; 28 cottagers received 11 
      cwt. each,&nbsp; but by 1926,&nbsp; inflation had eroded the value to only 
      12 cottagers receiving 8 cwt. each. </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >Messrs Ayres were always chosen to supply the 
      coal,&nbsp; in some cases despite lower tenders being received from other 
      coal merchants;&nbsp; the decision was not always unanimous.&nbsp; Indeed, 
      in 1903, it was felt important to note that Mr Trowbridge proposed that 
      Messrs Drake &amp; Mount of Bracknell,&nbsp; who had tendered 10% less per 
      ton, should supply the coals;&nbsp; no-one seconded this 
motion.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >The <b>Hurst Allwright 
      Charity</b> was first mentioned in 1906.&nbsp; It provided for, among 
      other items, firewood blocks and blankets.&nbsp; In 1910,&nbsp; it was 
      recorded that the "Allrights Charity" provided nearly 8 tons of coal 
      compared to 9 tons from the Fuel Allotment.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1924, the Charity Commissioners proposed to make 
      an alteration to the management of the Hurst Charities,&nbsp; separating 
      the Ecclesiastical from the non-Ecclesiastical Charities. The Council 
      Chairman John Simonds explained that there were 2 Ecclesiastical and 16 
      non-Ecclesiastical charities, together earning about £540 in that 
      year.&nbsp; (By the way,&nbsp; Newland and most of Arborfield Cross was in 
      the <b><i>ecclesiastical 
      parish</i></b> of Bearwood as recently as the late 1970's,&nbsp; though 
      for practical purposes,&nbsp; marriages and other rites of passage usually 
      took place in Arborfield Church).</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >The post of "Overseer" was abolished in 1927 under

      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >Very few houses had their own piped water 
      supply.&nbsp; The White Well was thus an important consideration.&nbsp; In 
      1896, it was decided to put a new oak curb and lid,&nbsp; and to raise the 
      brickwork one course higher. George Garrett was directed to complete the 
      work at the cost of 23/- and to do any necessary repairs to the 'Steining' 
      of the well.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      ><a href="images/Collier/Collier_A513.jpg" ><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The White Well, in front of Whitewell Cottages" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/Thumb/Collier/Collier_A513_detail.jpg" width="219" height="148" ></a>On April 
      15th 1903,&nbsp; a discussion took place as to whether a pump should be 
      put over the white well, and ultimately the matter was left for the 
      Council to decide,&nbsp; but the chairman was asked to write to the 
      district council surveyor, asking him to meet him and other members of the 
      Council to see if a drain and grating could be put there to catch drain 
      water. When they met him, the Road Surveyor suggested that channel bricks 
      be put down on the lower side of the well to run the splash water&nbsp; 
      "into the existing drain thereat",&nbsp; the bricks not to be more than 2 
      feet beyond the well on the Road side.&nbsp; The next council meeting 
      asked Mr. Garrett to do the work,&nbsp; and then voted to get White Well 
      cleaned twice a year at 2/6 each time.&nbsp; After this,&nbsp; no mention 
      of the well was made until 1915,&nbsp; when it was requested that the well 
      be cleaned and the cover repaired. </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >The bill for the repairs in 1916 was 6/6;&nbsp; 
      bearing in mind that an Audit Stamp would cost 5/-, the Chairman offered 
      to pay for it as long as there were no other expenses.&nbsp; It was then 
      requested that the White Well be cleaned out twice a year&nbsp; 
      (presumably this task had lapsed),&nbsp; but others thought this wasn't 
      necessary.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1924, "the Chairman reported that his attention 
      having been called to the fact that in consequence of the making up of the 
      Highway by the Berkshire County Council, the surface water from the road 
      was turned and entering into White Well making the water unfit for use; he 
      had (the matter being urgent) taken the responsibility of ordering the 
      necessary alterations to be made to prevent this state of affairs 
      continuing, without calling a meeting of the Council. The Council 
      concurred in the action taken".&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1927, the drain taking the overflow from White 
      Well was blocked and consequently the fronts of the cottages known as 
      White Well Cottages were in a flooded condition.&nbsp; Apparently the 
      major portion of the drain lay beneath the public footpath.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1930,&nbsp; the lid was again in bad condition and 
      needed replacing.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >By 1934,&nbsp; there was a crisis.&nbsp; At a special 
      meeting called on 4th April, the chairman explained that a letter had been 
      received from the R.D.C. stating that a sample of water taken from the 
      White Well&nbsp; (a spring that had supplied the village for longer period 
      than was known)&nbsp; had been analysed and proved to be unfit for 
      drinking or domestic purposes.&nbsp; As the Parish of Arborfield was 
      interested in the matter, Canon Anderson represented them at the 
      meeting.&nbsp; Newland Parish Council then arranged for two samples to be 
      taken for independent analysis.&nbsp; By the 18th,&nbsp; the Public Health 
      Committee of the W.R.D.C. had taken steps to close the well "in the near 
      future".&nbsp; The Parish Council asked for no action to be taken before 
      the independent analysis was complete.&nbsp; At a meeting on 28th 
      June,&nbsp; two reports were discussed;&nbsp; the first,&nbsp; a Chemical 
      Examination from the County Analyst,&nbsp; stated that the water was fit 
      for drinking and domestic purposes.&nbsp; The second,&nbsp; from the 
      Pathological Laboratory at the Royal Berkshire Hospital,&nbsp; showed the 
      presence of bacteria to a greater extent than it should,&nbsp; making it 
      unfit for domestic purposes; however, the Analyst didn't consider it fair 
      to condemn the water on one analysis because varying conditions of weather 
      could cause increase or decrease of bacteria.&nbsp; At yet another meeting 
      on 8th August,&nbsp; the Parish Council agreed to instal a pump and 
      close-in the well,&nbsp; and to remove a catch-pit,&nbsp; in order for the 
      W.R.D.C. to reverse the closure order.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >At the November meeting,&nbsp; the Clerk reported 
      that,&nbsp; as instructed,&nbsp; he obtained a tender from Mr. Bullock of 
      Wokingham for £15 and one from Mr. A Barker and Son of Arborfield for 
      £12,&nbsp; which was accepted.&nbsp; The work had been completed and a 
      semi-rotary pump was installed.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >This was not the end to the matter . . . In 
      1936,&nbsp; the Chairman reported that the waste-water drain had become 
      blocked,&nbsp; and in consequence the front of one of the White Well 
      cottages was under water. . . it transpired that the pump was frozen 
      up.&nbsp; Later that year,&nbsp; it was again decided to give the well a 
      twice-yearly clean-up,&nbsp; as the W.R.D.C. might take samples of water 
      for analysis at any time.&nbsp; </span></p>

      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >Footpaths were a vital part of life in the days 
      before cars and buses; consequently,&nbsp; they were kept in reasonable 
      repair. In 1898,&nbsp; the Clerk was ordered to employ a man to trim the 
      edges of the footpath leading to the Church,&nbsp; in the Parish of 
      Newland,&nbsp; and to gravel it.&nbsp; It was again mentioned in 
      1925,&nbsp; and in 1927,&nbsp; it was reported that the kissing gate and 
      fence of the Church path had been repaired and painted.</span></p>

      1903, John Simonds, Chairman,&nbsp; having reported that he had ordered 
      the stile on the foot path between the Village and the School to be 
      repaired,&nbsp; it was decided that the cost be borne by the 
      Council.&nbsp; The chairman was instructed to write to the district 
      council about the bridge in Cole Lane.&nbsp; In the same year, a precept 
      was issued for 10/- for payment of Mr Wells "for four loads of gravel 
      &amp; carting &amp; putting on footpath at the back of Mr Trowbridge's 
      house."</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >By 1904,&nbsp; the footpath to the school was again 
      giving trouble.&nbsp; A detailed proposal was accepted&nbsp; "that 
      sufficient of the earth be removed&nbsp; (at the west side of the stile in 
      field leading to the School)&nbsp; to allow the water to drain off, the 
      earth removed to be thrown into the path, and a load of unscreened gravel 
      put on the top of do., it was also arrainged&nbsp; (sic)&nbsp; that an 
      additional slab&nbsp; (to widen the footway) and an extra post &amp; hand 
      rail be fixed at the side of do.,&nbsp; Mr. Garrett was asked to do the 
      work".&nbsp; In 1919,&nbsp; Mr Wade Isaac wrote to the council calling 
      attention to the state of the stile at the footpath across his meadow, by 
      the School road, asking for it to be repaired.&nbsp; Again,&nbsp; in 
      1927,&nbsp; the stile had to be repaired because it was a danger to the 
      users, especially the schoolchildren.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1908,&nbsp; it was decided to repair the path 
      leading from the stile to the end of buildings at the back of Captain 
      Wright's house.&nbsp; "Mr. A C Tayler and Mr. G. Bentley were requested to 
      order the quantity of gravel required,&nbsp; Mr. John Simonds kindly 
      offering to cart it." </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >Messrs Brooks of Barkham wrote about the "raising of 
      the stile of footpath, at the back of Major Harris's house".&nbsp; The 
      council replied that "a Parish Council is authorised to repair or remove 
      an existing stile or gate,&nbsp; if such alteration is necessary for the 
      public,&nbsp; but they do not consider such to be the case with the stile 
      you refer to."</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1913,&nbsp; Shinfield Parish Council complained to 
      Newland Council about the dangerous state of the footbridge over the 
      Loddon by Arborfield Hall. Newland replied that the bridge was not in the 
      parish anyway,&nbsp; and it was believed that the W.R.D.C. had repaired it 
      before.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1917,&nbsp; Mr Dimond,&nbsp; a Councillor from 
      Carters' Hill,&nbsp; spoke of the dangerous state of the footbridge across 
      the brook in the lane near his farm,&nbsp; and suggested that the Parish 
      Council deal with it.&nbsp; The meeting discussed liability, and decided 
      that the W.R.D.C. had renewed and kept in repair the other footbridges at 
      Hughes Green and Cold Lane (sic).&nbsp; By April 1918,&nbsp; Mr Dimond 
      reported that the W.R.D.C. had repaired it.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the 
      footbridge "in the Holt wood" was again unsafe in 1922.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >Much heat was generated in 1921 when a stile had been 
      placed at the Coombes Lane end of the Public Footpath across the corner of 
      Bear Wood Estate in place of a wicket gate.&nbsp; The Estate bordered 
      "Newlands" - where John Simonds lived.&nbsp; It was pointed out by him to 
      Captain Jenks, Governor of the Royal Merchant Seamen's Orphanage, that 
      "the Public were entitled to equal facilities as previously 
      existed".&nbsp; After a few years,&nbsp; the Estate was eventually forced 
      to re-instate the gate,&nbsp; which still exists today. </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1931,&nbsp; the three footbridges over the Mole 
      Brook were again in a poor state. By this time,&nbsp; the County Council 
      took over responsibility for their upkeep from the W.R.D.C., but their 
      first efforts at repair drew complaints from the Parish Council,&nbsp; and 
      the subject re-appeared in 1933 and again in 1936,&nbsp; when the bridge 
      in Cole Lane was rebuilt by the County Council.&nbsp; The bridge in Holt 
      Wood&nbsp; (Carter's Hill) was declared unsafe in 1937.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1934, Mr Jarvis brought to the notice of the 
      Council that Mr Isaac was keeping a bull in a meadow across which was 
      public footpath.&nbsp; The Council considered that it was "undesirable 
      that he should turn a bull into the meadow". </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >The Chairman undertook in 1938 to communicate with 
      the Governor of what had become the Royal Merchant Navy School&nbsp; "with 
      reference to the overgrowth of the public footpath across the park from 
      Mole Lane to Cole Lane"&nbsp; (actually - Coombes Lane).&nbsp; The stile 
      (in Mole Lane?) was repaired in 1939,&nbsp; as was one near Birch 
      House.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >Post-war (in 1947),&nbsp; motorbikes became a problem 
      in Cole Lane, "rendering it almost unusable for householders living in the 
      Coombes, and for farmers wishing to gain access to their fields on either 
      side."</span></p>

      "asking for information as to whether the road leading from Sindlesham 
      Road by the Larch fir plantation to Berry Grove (sic) Carters Hill is a 
      Public or a Private Road, as there had been complaints made as to its bad 
      condition."&nbsp; The R.D.C.'s Highways Committee then stated that&nbsp; 
      "the road in question appears to be a soft public highway and has not been 
      metalled or repaired by the District Council".&nbsp; The poor state of 
      this road was again mentioned in 1925;&nbsp; the area was written down in 
      the Minutes as "Betty Grove",&nbsp; later corrected to "Berry 
      Grove".</span></p>

      new.&nbsp; At the Annual Parish Meeting in 1910,&nbsp; Mr F W Seymour 
      stated that he&nbsp; "considered the Motor Cars passed through the Village 
      at too great a speed for the safety of the inhabitants, and proposed that 
      notices warning the drivers to go slowly through the Village should be 
      placed at the sides of the Main Road at both ends of the Villages", which 
      was seconded and carried.&nbsp; The County Surveyor was contacted,&nbsp; 
      who arranged to that "the Notices were duly fixed".</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1927,&nbsp; "the attention of the Council having 
      been called to the dangerous condition of the pit on the frontage of Mr

      at once take steps to have the pit filled up." </span></p>

      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >After the Second World War,&nbsp; traffic was 
      increased to the extent that footpaths were needed along School Road from 
      the Cross to the school,&nbsp; and along Eversley Road from the Cross to 
      Targett's Farm.&nbsp; The Council petitioned the W.R.D.C. in 1947.&nbsp; 
      The road itself was in a state;&nbsp; pools of water collected at the 
      Cross near the Memorial and the Green;&nbsp; there were still barbed wire 
      entanglements at the Cross;&nbsp; sign-boards were still missing following 
      the war; and the pond opposite the Bull was considered a 
      nuisance.</span></p>

      Secondary Education".&nbsp; After the Chairman had reported that he had

      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>The Members of the Arborfield Parish 
      Council have from time to time discussed the desirability of having a 
      playing field.&nbsp; Some time ago I saw Mr Isaac to see whether he would 
      sell the northern end of his field across which a footpath runs diagonally 
      between the School and the village.&nbsp; At first, he expressed 
      willingness to discuss it but then said he would not entertain the 
      idea.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>Recently,&nbsp; Mr Reilly,&nbsp; Secretary 
      of the Berks,&nbsp; Bucks and Oxon National Fitness Committee met members 
      of the Parish Council with me, to look into the possibilities. He did not 
      like Mr Isaac's field because of the footpath.&nbsp; We therefore made a 
      tour to shew him how very limited the level spaces are,&nbsp; and came to 
      the conclusion the best possible site is on your property.&nbsp; I 
      therefore promised to approach you to ask whether you would be willing to 
      try to make this idea possible.&nbsp; Mr Bowyer is your tenant I 
      understand,&nbsp; of this level site and naturally we do not know either 
      what his feelings or your would be.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>The position is as follows.&nbsp; We 
      believe the National Fitness Committee would contribute half the cost of 
      acquiring the land levelling as necessary,&nbsp; of sowing grass 
      seed,&nbsp; of fencing and of providing a pavilion.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span

      yards by 120 yards and I have taken the liberty of shewing the arrangement 
      he suggested shown upon your land on the enclosed rough plan&nbsp; (no 
      longer existing).</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>Now the great thing is,&nbsp; 
      please,&nbsp; would you and the Newland Parish be willing and able to 
      cooperate in this scheme?&nbsp; I must tell you we have about £150

      for upkeep, out of proportion to the capacity of the 
      inhabitants.</span></i></p>

      rate of 3d in the £1 could be levied,&nbsp; this would produce, say, £90 
      at most, insufficient to provide the wages of a full-time 
      groundsman,&nbsp; whose services would,&nbsp; most certainly,&nbsp; be 
      needed.</span></i></p>

      satisfied that the Highways Authority would never sanction an entrance 
      directly off the Causeway or Main Road - the most dangerous approach to 
      the village,&nbsp; and if children are to be catered for,&nbsp; it is

      >At the 1914 Annual Parish Meeting,&nbsp; Mr G R 
      Hayward complained that, although some parts had 2 or 3 postal deliveries 
      a day,&nbsp; he &amp; others living but a short distance from the Post 
      Office had only one delivery,&nbsp; and asked that the Postmaster at 
      Reading should be written to on the matter.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1924,&nbsp; a letter was received from the Acting 
      Postmaster of Reading,&nbsp; stating "that the Postmen employed at 
      Arborfield Cross had made an application for a weekly half-holiday on 
      Saturday afternoons to be afforded by suspending the evening letter-box 
      collection in the whole of the Postal District served from that 
      office,&nbsp; including Newlands.&nbsp; It was explained that under this 
      arrangement the second delivery on Saturdays would be accelerated by about 
      one hour,&nbsp; and the second despatch of letters would be at about 2.40 
      o'clock".&nbsp; The Council assented to this change.</span></p>

      >In April 1914,&nbsp; Mr Seymour raised the question 
      of applying to the Authorities to install a Public Telephone Call Office 
      in the village.&nbsp; This subject was delayed until the next meeting in 
      March 1915, when the Clerk reported that he had written to the 
      Authorities,&nbsp; and had received a reply.&nbsp; He also read out&nbsp; 
      a list of 8 persons who had informed him that a Call Office would be 
      useful to them.&nbsp; Apparently,&nbsp; a guarantee of about £15 would be 
      required.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1928, the Council passed the following Resolution: 
      "Seeing that the Telephone Authorities are proposing to carry Lines up to 
      the Village, and fearing that if carried on Poles,&nbsp; the beauty of the 
      Village will be very much impaired,&nbsp; this Council consider that it is 
      desirable the Clerk be instructed to write to the Public Telephones 
      Department, asking that the wires be taken underground".&nbsp; It appears 
      that this request went un-heeded.</span></p>

      >In 1923,&nbsp; the Chairman raised the question of 
      the rubbish being dumped,&nbsp; by the Villagers,&nbsp; "at the end of 
      Coombes Lane"&nbsp; (actually Coles Lane),&nbsp; near his cottages,&nbsp; 
      and stated that he understood that the rubbish was being deposited in such 
      a manner that it was becoming an obstruction.&nbsp; Mr Ernest 
      Bowyer,&nbsp; a councillor and the tenant of Newland Farm,&nbsp; supported 
      this statement and mentioned that on one occasion when he was sending his 
      carts down the Lane he had to send a man to throw the rubbish back,&nbsp; 
      before they could go past.&nbsp; A complaint was made to the W.R.D.C., who 
      replied that the Parish Council should make arrangements for the 
      collection and disposal of house refuse in the Parish,&nbsp; the expense 
      of which would be a special charge on the Parish.&nbsp; The Parish Council 
      decided that this would be too expensive,&nbsp; and decided that a Notice 
      Board should be fixed in the Lane:</span></p>

      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"

      them to comply with the request,&nbsp; while Mr Bowyer undertook to have 
      the existing rubbish sorted and carted away at a later date,&nbsp; the 
      cost of the sorting to be paid by the Parish Council.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In 1929,&nbsp; the heap of rubbish had again assumed 
      large proportions.&nbsp; A discussion ensued in which Mr Simonds remarked 
      on the growing difficulties encountered by villages regarding the disposal 
      of refuse.&nbsp; Mr Bowyer of Newland Farm and Mr Jarvis were appointed to 
      make the necessary arrangements to clear the rubbish.&nbsp; They reported 
      back that&nbsp; "it was of such a size that the sum of £3 suggested by the 
      late Chairman for its removal was not sufficient to cover the expense and 
      also,&nbsp; it was a difficult matter to find a convenient place to dump 
      it".&nbsp; They nevertheless sorted and cleared it&nbsp; "at as low a cost 
      as possible",&nbsp; though a year later,&nbsp; Mr Bowyer said that he was 
      still unable to find a dump for the tins left over from the sorting of the 
      refuse heap in Cole Lane. </span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >By the end of 1930,&nbsp; as the W.R.D.C. were now 
      collecting the refuse,&nbsp; the notice in Cole Lane was altered to give 
      notice that no rubbish be deposited. &nbsp;(In 1994, there was still a 
      heap of garden rubbish at this spot!).</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >In May 1942,&nbsp; the W.R.D.C. asked the Parish 
      Council to appoint a Salvage Steward to assist and cooperate with the 
      District Council in collection of Salvage in the parish.&nbsp; "Mr 
      Verrall,&nbsp; the Schoolmaster,&nbsp; having,&nbsp; with the help of the 
      school children,&nbsp; carried on the collection of Salvage for many 
      months, was asked to attend the meeting in the school,&nbsp; and to give 
      his help.&nbsp; This he did, and clearly explained the manner in which he 
      had carried on,&nbsp; and explained that the task had got larger than he 
      could manage.&nbsp; The W.I. was asked if it could help., and Mr Chitty 
      offered the use of his yard for collecting scrap iron.</span></p>

      lang=EN-GB>"Sir,&nbsp; The Parish Councils of Newland 
      and Arborfield at a joint meeting held on Friday the 9th January, desire 
      to bring to your attention the inadequacy of the omnibus services between 
      Arborfield Cross and Reading.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>Some correspondence has lately passed 
      between your office and the Chairman of Arborfield Parish Council, both in 
      an official and unofficial capacity.&nbsp; Your final letter of the 7th 
      December last was not considered satisfactory, and two points in 
      particular we wish to take up:</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(1) That the difficulties on our Route are 
      not regular but spasmodic, and are no worse than on any other routes of 
      the Region;&nbsp;&nbsp; and</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(2) That the villagers of Arborfield must 
      arrange their shopping expeditions at times which do not coincide with 
      those when the majority of troops normally travel.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >The Parish Councils concerned desire to put before 
      you the following facts:</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(1) A 'bus service designed for a 
      population in Arborfield and Newland of 600 (apart from the other places 
      served on the route)&nbsp; is inadequate to deal with the addition of four 
      permanent training camps with a personnel of some 5,000.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(2) These camps are situated up to a mile 
      on the south side of Arborfield Cross, and in consequence military 
      personnel fill up the 'buses before the main centre of population is 
      reached at the Cross.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(3) The four camps are <u 
      >permanent</u> training camps and so differ from 
      combatant units in that many of the Instructors have their families either 
      in the camp or in the vicinity and so the civilian population of the 
      district has been increased.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(4) There is no time of the day at which 
      the service is slack.&nbsp; Military leave, both daily and period,&nbsp; 
      is staggered,&nbsp; and certain personnel have leave at all hours of the 
      day.&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp; London leave is usually granted at,&nbsp; 
      or before, 10 a.m.&nbsp; That is the main cause of the recent aggravation 
      of the difficulties of the local inhabitants,&nbsp; i.e. their inability 
      to get to Reading in the earlier part of the morning. It is a frequent 
      occurrence,&nbsp; as shown by evidence from our local Schoolmaster,&nbsp; 
      for no buses to stop at Arborfield Cross between 8 a.m. and 4.20 
      p.m.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(5) It is not in accordance with the facts 
      that villagers use the 'buses only for shopping expeditions or 
      pleasure.&nbsp; There are several residents who are doing war work in 
      Reading,&nbsp; both under the National Service Act and voluntarily, who 
      find it increasingly difficult to get on to the 'buses in the morning and 
      who are left in the Station Square in Reading an hour or more,&nbsp; 
      because the queue is longer than he 'buses will accommodate.&nbsp; School 
      children and teachers are similarly affected.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(6) The Statement that our service is no 
      worse than any other on the Thames Valley service cannot be borne out by 
      ocular evidence at the Station Square, Reading.&nbsp; The Arborfield queue 
      is by far the longest.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>(7) The suggestions we have to make are 
      twofold:</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB 
      >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      (a) That on home or period leave the camps find their own transport for 
      their personnel to and from Reading.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB 
      >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      (b) That a relief' bus should be run regularly on the 10.10 a.m. and 1.50 
      p.m. from Arborfield Cross,&nbsp; or alternatively that a shuttle service 
      should be run at intervals between Arborfield Cross and Reading 
      only.</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>Our two Councils therefore urge that the 
      problem may receive the sympathetic consideration of the Transport 
      Commissioner with a view to amelioration of the present 
      difficulties.&nbsp; </span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>We are, Yours faithfully,&nbsp; J H 
      Simonds,&nbsp; Chairman,&nbsp; Newland Parish Council, and A H 
      Capper,&nbsp; Chairman,&nbsp; Arborfield Parish Council".</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >The Regional Transport Commissioner replied on 19th 
      January:</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span

      Piggott to acknowledge receipt of the letter of the 11th January 1943 from 
      the Parish Councils of Newland and Arborfield about the omnibus services 
      between Arborfield Cross and Reading. Enquiries made by the Commissioner 
      have confirmed that the difficulties are aggravated by the practice by the 
      Military Authorities of granting London leave at or before 10 a.m. and the 
      'bus company is in consultation with the Military Authorities with a view 
      to arranging the times of release of personnel proceeding on leave.&nbsp; 
      It is hoped to obtain alleviation of the difficulties in this 
      connection,&nbsp; failing which,&nbsp; efforts will be made by the company 
      to operate one or two additional journeys between 9 &amp; 10 a.m.&nbsp;

      that parish,&nbsp; as from 25th March 1883,&nbsp; under the divided 
      Parishes Act,&nbsp; 1882,&nbsp; it appears however to have been always

      the Local Government Act 1894,&nbsp; of the Parish of Wokingham 
      Without,&nbsp; the rates have been levied by Wokingham,&nbsp; and persons 
      residing in the area have been included in the Voters' and jurors' lists

      Parish Councils . . . met yesterday . . . A full and frank discussion took 
      place and it was agreed that the site is suitable for the limited number 
      of houses which may be found to be needed in the centre of the Area, after 
      the War.&nbsp; At the same time, it is appreciated that the area comprised 
      in the two Parishes is scattered and accommodation will probably be needed 
      in the more outlying parts.&nbsp; </span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>Both Councils have for some time seen the 
      urgent need for the provision of a children's Play-ground closely 
      adjoining the School,&nbsp; and the site mentioned in your letter is felt 
      to be by far the most appropriate.&nbsp; In the opinion of the Councils it 
      would be essential if the site is acquired for housing that the layout be 
      so arranged as to embody,&nbsp; not only a playground,&nbsp; but also a 
      portion for School garden plots which,&nbsp; up to the present time,&nbsp; 
      have had to be found a long distance from the School.&nbsp; 
</span></i></p>
      <p class="stbody"><i><span 
      lang=EN-GB>Both Councils are most anxious to retain 
      the character of the Village,&nbsp; and are strongly opposed to any form 
      of ribbon development;&nbsp; they would prefer any building to be erected 
      on the proposed site to be placed at the North West end, possibly in the 
      form of a crescent."</span></i></p>

      >Few complaints from parishioners at Annual Parish 
      Meetings were recorded before 1914,&nbsp; which is not to say that they 
      weren't aired.&nbsp; In that year,&nbsp; there was a complaint about 
      different levels of service for postal deliveries.</span></p>
      <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB" 
      >At the same meeting,&nbsp; Mr Jonas Isaac complained 
      of the state of the pond near his farm,&nbsp; and suggested that "it was 
      the duty of the Parish Council to see to it's [its?] being cleaned 
      out".&nbsp; The clerk pointed out that when the pond at Arborfield was 
      cleaned out under the direction of the Arborfield Parish Meeting, and the 
      Accounts were brought before the Government Auditor, the Council was 
      warned that the Parish had no right to clean out ponds;&nbsp; such work 
      was an R.D.C. matter,&nbsp; and if the Parish undertook such work in 
      future,&nbsp; the Overseers would be surcharged the amount to be 
      paid.&nbsp; </span></p>

      remarked on the small amount of interest taken in Parish affairs by the 
      Parishioners during the whole time since 1894.&nbsp; There was rarely a 
      need to have a ballot to elect Councillors.&nbsp; In 1931, the Annual 
      Parish Meeting consisted of just five Councillors who were 
      re-elected,&nbsp; and the Clerk (then George Garrett). </span></p>
