<p class="stbody">The main link we now have with the Hargreaves family is the 'Hargreaves Pews' in 
the Chancel of the Victorian Arborfield Church. However, they were major 
Arborfield landowners of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Here's the family's Coat 
of Arms:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">
<img src="images/Hargreaves_Coat_Of_Arms.jpg" width="329" height="439" class="auto-style1"></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Arborfield Hall</b> was bought as a wedding present for
<strong>Thomas and Sarah Hargreaves</strong> 
from the <a href="families_conroy.htm"><strong>Conroy</strong></a> family in 1855. Thomas was the son of a Cotton Spinner from 
<b>Accrington, Lancashire</b>. His father John rose from office cleaner boy to a large 
manufacturer, amassing a large fortune. Thomas called himself “<b>Captain Hargreaves</b>”, 
on the strength of his being a Captain of Volunteers, or a Militia, in a trading 
town.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Shortly after moving in, <b>Mrs. Hargreaves</b> discovered 
that she was <b>related to the Dawson’s</b>, through an American branch of the family. The 1901 
Census shows that Sarah herself was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in about 
1834.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The Conroys looked down on the Hargreaves because they were 
considered “trade”.<strong><a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1313210.PDF"><img alt="" class="auto-style2" height="200" src="images/new/Boat_at_Arborfield_Hall_1865.jpg" style="float: right" width="316"></a></strong></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><strong>
<a href="C19/families_Thomas_Hargreaves_Arborfield.htm">Captain Hargreaves</a></strong> was initially the model of respectability, 
becoming a <strong>J.P.</strong> <strong>on the Wokingham Bench</strong> in 
1859, a <strong>Steward of Berkshire</strong> in 1864, rising to <strong>High 
Steward of Berkshire</strong> (involving him in various ceremonial duties) in 
1867. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">He worked on the property, improving the mill channel of 
	  the <strong>River Loddon</strong> as a decorative feature for the formal gardens, seen here 
	  in this <strong>
	  <a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1313210.PDF">picture available on the Reading Local Studies web-site</a></strong>. His 
	  initials and the date ('T.H. 1863') can still be made out in an inscription 
	  on the stout wall of the mill-stream (<a href="C21/properties_Hall_2011.htm#TH1863"><strong>see 
	  article on the Loddon here</strong></a>). &nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="stbody">In 1863, his relative, <strong>
	  <a href="church_new_building1.htm">Sir William Brown, Bart., 
	  of Liverpool</a></strong>, provided funds to replace the dilapidated old 
	  church building with a new one on land closer to Arborfield Cross, employing 
	  contractors from Liverpool to carry out the work, which cost over £4,000. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">The family raised eight children at Arborfield Hall - 
	  but in 1870 the family was rocked by scandal when it was revealed in a 
	  court case (not published locally) that Thomas had had a relationship with a 
	  <strong>Mrs. Warriner</strong>. Only a month later, he bought a property known as
	  <a href="C19/families_Thomas_Hargreaves.htm"><strong>The Mount, 
	  Bishopstoke</strong></a> on the banks of the<strong> River Itchen</strong> and gradually he and Mrs. 
	  Warriner were accepted in Hampshire as a couple. On the other hand, Thomas 
	  was almost air-brushed out of Arborfield life during the 1870s, only 
	  receiving a brief mention in the loacl press - though he was mentioned 
	  almost weekly in Hampshire newspapers. 
	  <img alt="" height="236" src="images/new/Will_J_H_Aldershot_Military_Gazette_12041873.jpg" style="float: right" width="266"></p>
	  <p class="stbody">In 1873, Thomas' father John died, and left most of his 
	  considerable fortune to his eldest son and daughter-in-law. Thomas 
	  received £120,000 (enough to build a couple of dozen new Arborfield 
	  churches!), while Sarah received no less than £200,000.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong>Sarah</strong> was left to finish their 
	  children's education and to introduce them to marriage partners. She did 
	  well for them, according to the <strong>
	  <a href="C19/families_Hargreaves_Children.htm">glowing reports of their weddings</a></strong>. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">&nbsp;The owner of Arborfield Hall retained the 
	  'Patronage' for selecting the clergy of the parish of St. Bartholomews; 
	  but after <strong>Sir John Hayes, Bart.</strong>, had announced his 
	  retirement, it wasn't Thomas who carried out this duty. Instead, the 
	  following report appeared in many newspapers around the country. In the 
	  'Ecclesiastical' column of the Derby Mercury of 24th September 1879, it 
	  listed:</p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong><em>&quot;Rev. S. W. L. Walsh, rector of Arborfield, 
	  near Reading; patron, Mrs. Hargeaves, of Arborfield Hall&quot;</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
       
<p class="stbody">Mrs. Hargreaves enlarged the house and put in electric light using the old 
<strong><a href="properties_mill.htm">Mill</a></strong> 
for making electricity. The Hargreaves made the Hall one of the centres of 
village life, as can be seen from extracts of Parish Magazines, plus Mrs. 
Hargreaves was a generous benefactor. The <strong>
<a href="C19/properties_Reading_Room.htm">Reading Room</a></strong>, built in memory 
of their son <strong>Arthur</strong> in 1881, was a great asset.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><strong>Thomas</strong> died at his club in London in September, 1891, 
	  upon which local newspapers the length and breadth of England carried 
	  glowing obituaries, though the Berkshire newspapers were silent. They did 
	  however report on Thomas' burial at Arborfield. The contents of his Will 
may have been a surprise to some - it mentions<strong> <span class="auto-style3">
two</span></strong> sons, not one (<strong>John Reginald</strong>). The second 
son <strong>Cecil Montague</strong> was born in 1871 at Bishopstoke to Mrs. 
Warriner.</p>
	  <p class="stbody">After Sarah's death in early 1918 (for Sarah's Obituary, click <b>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Mrs_Hargreaves.htm">here</a></b>), her son John became the new owner, 
but he didn’t like Arborfield. In 1919 and in 1924 he put the Hall up for sale, 
but unsuccessfully. However he finally succeeded in 1926, after which he severed 
	  his connection with Arborfield, though a <strong>
	  <a href="C19/families_Hargreaves_Children.htm#John_R_Death">memorial 
	  service for John Reginald Hargreaves</a></strong> was held in Arborfield 
	  following his death in December 1934. </p>

<p class="stbody">The <strong><a href="C20/families_Ditchfield.htm">Rev. Peter Ditchfield</a></strong>, Rector of Barkham and a noted local 
historian (he edited the Victoria County History and wrote over 100 books), had 
a weekly History column in the Reading Mercury. In the 14th June 1930 edition, 
he made a plea:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><em>“Several years ago, I wrote for the late 
Mr Hargreaves of Arborfield Hall “</em><b><em>The History of the Dawson Family of Ferreby, 
in the County of York, and of Arborfield Hall, Berkshire</em></b><em>”. It was published 
privately by Messrs. George Allen &amp; Sons, Ruskin’s publishers. Unfortunately, 
all the copies have been dispersed. I should be grateful if anyone who possesses 
a copy will allow me to purchase it. The last one I inadvertently sent to 
America in response to an urgent request.”</em></span></p>
	  <p class="stbody">- Happily, Arborfield Local History Society now has 
	  an electronic copy of this book. Peter Ditchfield was able to trace 
	  Sarah's direct lineage way back to <strong>King Edward III</strong>, so he certainly earned 
	  his commission.</p>
