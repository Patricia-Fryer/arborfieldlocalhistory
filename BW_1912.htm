<p class="stbody">The <strong><a href="properties_bearwood.htm">Bearwood Estate</a></strong> 
had been <strong>put up for auction in 1911</strong>. Around half, known as the
<strong><a href="BW_1911_outlying_portions.htm">'outlying portions'</a></strong>, 
	  were parcelled up into 124 Lots and offered for sale over three days in 
	  March 1911, but many failed to sell. The remainder of the Estate surrounding the Mansion and 
	  its ornamental parkland was offered for sale in five large Lots at an
	  <strong><a href="BW_1911_mansion_etc.htm">auction in London in July 1911</a></strong>, 
but surprisingly, not one of the Lots reached the reserve price and all were 
withdrawn.</p>
	  <p class="stbody">In September 1912, another attempt was made by the 
	  Executors to sell the remaining outlying portions. An advertisement 
	  appeard in the Reading Mercury of 14th September:</p>

	  <p class="stbody">The Reading Mercury of 21st September recorded the 
	  rather disappointing outcome, at least as far as the Executors were 
	  concerned.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style8"><strong><span class="auto-style10">THE BEAR WOOD 
	  ESTATE<br><br>SALES AT READING.</span></strong><br></p>
	  <p class="stbody">The depressed condition of the Estate Market, owing to 
	  recent and threatened legislation, and to other causes, was again 
	  evidenced on Thursday and yesterday (Friday) when, by direction of the 
	  executors, outlying portions of the Bear Wood estate in Berkshire and 
	  Hampshire came under the hammer in the Town Hall, Reading. <br><br>The 
	  auctioneers were Messrs. Trollope, of Mount-street, Grosvenor-square, 
	  etc., Mr. H. C. Trollope and Mr. James Baker, of that firm, selling 
	  alternately. The solicitors were Messrs. Cooke, Cooper and Barry, of 
	  Wokingham, and Messrs. Soames, Edwards and Jones, of Lennox-street, 
	  Strand, W.C., these firms being represented respectively by Mr. Barry and 
	  Mr. Edmonds. There was a good and representative attendance at Thursday's 
	  auction, but proceedings were far from spirited.<br><br>Mr. Trollope 
	  remarked that for some time past they had been realising a good deal of 
	  the outlying portion of the Bear Wood Estate, and a very considerable 
	  total sum had been obtained; but they wanted to sell more. The reserves on 
	  this week's lots had been modified very considerably as compared with 
	  previous offers, so that it would not be the fault of the vendors if they 
	  did not sell. A further and unusual offer was made on this occasion, viz., 
	  that two thirds of the purchase money on any lot could be left on mortgage 
	  at 4½ per cent.<br><br>The nationalisation [meaning <strong>
	  <a href="BW_1911_outlying_portions.htm#Note_that_Lot_128">transfer to the 
	  National Trust?</a></strong>] of the <strong>view from the famous 
	  Finchampstead Ridges</strong> would soon, they hoped, be accomplished, and 
	  negotiations were now in progress with <strong>Water and Gas Companies</strong> 
	  to bring supplies to the Ridges, and then on to <strong>Crowthorne Village</strong>, 
	  and <strong>Mr. Walter</strong> was prepared to meet the companies on vary 
	  favourable terms; but the reserves had not been increased in consequence 
	  of these projected improvements. Lots 35 and 72 had been sold by private 
	  treaty, and lot 8 (three and a half acres of woodland, to the west of
	  <strong>“North Court”</strong>), had been withdrawn. They had had 
	  proposals for a good many other lots, but the vendors, to avoid 
	  disappointment, had decided that the auction should go through in the 
	  usual way.<br><br>The lots were then submitted. <strong>Lots 1, 2 and 6</strong> 
	  were sold to <strong>Mr. Denys Egginton</strong> (Messrs. Egginton and 
	  Son, auctioneers and valuers, Reading), for one client; <strong>lot 4</strong> 
	  was knocked down to <strong>Mr. Monk Smith</strong>; <strong>lot 5</strong> 
	  to <strong>Mr. Reynolds</strong>, and <strong>lot 32</strong> to <strong>
	  Mr. W. M. Colebrook</strong> (Messrs. Colebrook and Co., Reading), the 
	  names of the other purchasers not being divulged. Out of the 33 lots 
	  offered on Thursday, <strong>only eight were sold</strong>, the total 
	  amount realised by the day's sale being but £2,520. <br><br>The lots 
	  disposed of were:-<br><strong>Lot 1</strong>, 7a. 0r. 34p., of freehold 
	  accommodation grass land, now let to <strong>Mr. F. J. Milam</strong> at 
	  £7 10s. per annum - £170, <strong>Mr. Egginton</strong>. <br><strong>Lot 2</strong>, 
	  the freehold residence known as <strong>“China Cottage”, Longwater Lane</strong>, 
	  near Finchampstead, with capital garden, the whole extending to about 1r. 
	  12p., let to <strong>Miss Taylor</strong> at £30 per annum - £420, <strong>
	  Mr. Egginton</strong>.<br><strong>Lot 4</strong>, a pair of superior 
	  cottages on<strong> Cricket Hill, Finchampstead</strong>, the actual and 
	  apportioned rental being £15 12s. per annum - £320, <strong>Mr. Monk Smith</strong>.<br>
	  <strong>Lot 5</strong>, a pair of freehold cottages adjoining the 
	  foregoing, producing together £13 per annum - £280, <strong>Mr. Reynolds</strong>.<br>
	  <strong>Lot 6</strong>, a pair of freehold cottages, close to the above, 
	  producing a total rental of £18 4s. per annum - £300, <strong>Mr. Egginton</strong>.<br>
	  <strong>Lot 12</strong>, freehold building site of 3a. 3r. 30p., close to
	  <strong>Wellington College Statio</strong>n - £400.<br><strong>Lot 32</strong>, 
	  a woodland site of 4a. 0r. 24p., with cottages between Wokingham and 
	  Wellington College Stations, £380, <strong>Mr. Colebrook</strong>.<br><br>
	  The results of yesterday's auction were even more disappointing, only 
	  three lots being actually knocked down out of 35 offered, although the low 
	  reserves, and special conditions, should have tempted investors. The whole 
	  amount realised was £895, but <strong>Mr. Trollope</strong> announced that
	  <strong>lot 72 – a freehold residence close to Wokingham Station</strong>, 
	  let to <strong>Mr. A. Andrews</strong>, with a small piece of ground, the 
	  whole comprising 4a. 1r. 8p., and producing an actual and estimated rental 
	  of £98 7s. 3d. per annum, had been disposed of privately. <br><br>The lots 
	  finding purchasers yesterday were: - <br><strong>Lot 37</strong>, a 
	  freehold cottage and garden known as <strong>“White Cottage”, Embrook
	  </strong>[sic], with a capital garden, let at 2s. per week, and thus 
	  producing a total rental of £5 4s. per annum, sold at £145.<br><strong>Lot 
	  70</strong>, <strong>“Bourton”</strong>, a freehold semi-detached villa 
	  residence, with stabling, garden, small lawn, &amp;c., let to <strong>Mr. E. 
	  A. Ballock</strong> at £27 10s. per annum, sold to <strong>Mr. J. H. Monk 
	  Smith</strong> at £400.<br><strong>Lot 71</strong>, An adjoining and 
	  similar residence, with stabling and garden, 0a. 6r. 27p., let to <strong>
	  Mr. J. H. Monk Smith</strong> at £28 per annum – <strong>Mr. Monk Smith</strong>, 
	  £330.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course the unsold lots are open for private treaty.</p>
