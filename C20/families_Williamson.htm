</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p><b>Albert George Brewer</b> was summoned at Wokingham on Tuesday for stealing 
a quantity of wines and a cigarette case valued at £8. 15s., the property of 
Mrs. Williamson, Arborfield Grange, Arborfield. He pleaded not guilty. <b>Mrs. 
E. M. Williamson</b>, of Arborfield Grange, stated that defendant was in her 
employ as butler. She went abroad last July and left Brewer in charge of the 
house. Some time after her return she had occasion to go to the Wine Cellar. She 
found the door was opened and most of the bins had been emptied. She called her 
Trustee and the cook. They went into defendant’s bedroom and on opening a drawer 
found the bottles of wine. Witness also stated that the cigarette case belonged 
to her husband.</p>
<p><b>Miss Elsie Russell</b>, housemaid at Arborfield Grange, said she knew that 
on September 6<sup>th</sup> defendant left to go to Reading. He later ‘phoned to 
say he would be back next day, and was everything all right?</p>
<p><b>Detective Sergeant Christopher</b> said he went to Arborfield Grange and 
saw bottles in a cupboard in defendant’s bedroom. He interviewed defendant who 
made a statement to the effect that he saw the keys and went to the cellar and 
took the wine. He also took the cigarette case and used it, but did not know it 
was on him until it was found in his pocket at the Police Station. Defendant, 
who had served in the Army at various times, was sentenced to three months’ hard 
labour.</p>
