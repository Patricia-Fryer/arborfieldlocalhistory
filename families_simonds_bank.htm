<p class="stbody">The Simonds family name lives on in the district, even though 
the family has moved away. In nearby Shinfield, it's possible to see the <b>Simonds 
Brewery</b> name on the <b>'Magpie and Parrot'</b> pub, while in central Reading, there's a 
brass name-plate for the <b>Simonds Bank</b>.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The Brewery and Bank were closely connected at first, as the 
following article shows. The Bank grew out of the Brewery.</p>

<p class="sthead"><b><font size="4">SIMONDS BANK AND ITS CONNECTIONS WITH 
ARBORFIELD</font></b></p>
<p class="stbody">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="stbody"><b>ROOTS</b></p>
<p class="stbody">In 1781, <b>William Blackall Simonds (1761-1834)</b> formed a banking 
partnership with <b>Robert Micklem</b> (a draper), <b>John Stephens</b> (another brewer) and 
<b>Robert Harris </b>(mealman), with a capital of £4,000. Their office was on the east 
side of the Market Place, ‘between John Deane (to north) and Widow Bailey (on 
the south)’. Rent was £55 per annum. From 1793 onwards, William also acted as 
Town Treasurer of Reading at different times.</p>
<p class="stbody"><b>W. B. Simonds</b> came of prosperous yeoman stock and inherited a 
malting and brewing business in Reading from his father in 1782. At first his 
main interest remained in brewing, but his efforts to expand it were frustrated 
by restrictive licensing laws and price fixing by the more powerful Berkshire 
brewers.</p>
<p class="stbody">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Simonds Bank at King Street, Reading, still recognisable today" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Bankbuilding1.jpg" width=273 height=238 >In 1814, thoroughly disillusioned, he decided to concentrate 
on banking, and left his eldest son <b>Blackall Simonds</b> to run the brewery. He 
dissolved his current banking partnership by mutual consent on 30<sup>th</sup> 
July 1814, receiving, so it seems, only 15 shillings "in sterling money" from 
his partners. On the next day established another banking house at No. 3 King 
Street. His new <b>partners</b> were his <b>younger son Henry (1795-1874)</b>, who had a 
thriving wine and spirit business, <b>two cousins John Simonds (1766-1845) of 
Arborfield</b> and <b>Charles Simonds (1768-1859) of Sindlesham</b>, who were in business 
together as mealmen at Sindlesham Mill, and a <b>Ralph Nicholson</b>.</p>
<p class="stbody">It was remarkable that <b>W. B. Simonds</b> was able to start a rival 
bank in the town immediately on breaking his original partnership agreement. It 
might have had something to do with the strength provided by two major accounts: 
the brewery and his son’s successful wine and spirit business. Further, he had 
been appointed Receiver General of Taxes for West Berkshire in 1791, and if he 
still held that position, then he could have used his tax receipts for up to six 
months before remitting them to London. In the meantime, the bank could have 
employed them for profit.</p>
<p class="stbody">The partnership was first represented in London by Messrs. 
Stephensons, Remmingtons and Smith of No. 69 Lombard Street, "at whose house 
their notes are payable", but by 1820 Williams &amp; Co. had become their London 
Agents.</p>
<p class="stbody">In 1816 <b>Ralph Nicholson</b> withdrew from the partnership, and 
William Blackall Simonds also retired. He was in fact Mayor of Reading that 
year. From this time onwards <b>the partners in the bank were all members of the Simonds family</b>. 
<b>Henry Simonds</b> retired in 1839 and <b>John</b> and <b>Charles</b> continued 
under the title <b>"John Simonds, Charles Simonds &amp; Co. Reading Bank"</b>. It kept this 
name until it amalgamated with Barclay and Company in 1913.</p>
<p class="stbody">Back in 1791, Reading was primarily a communications centre 
based on the River Thames and the Kennet Navigation (later in 1810 the Kennet 
and Avon Canal linking the Thames to Bristol), and on its roads. Its industry 
was in decline. One industry to survive the decline in Reading was its 
speciality of converting barley into malt. It was considered to be the most 
important area for malting in Britain. The brewers and maltsters made a great 
use of the canals and River Thames especially to send malt to the London 
brewers. Thus, <b>W. B. Simonds</b> could see the chance to serve these interests at a 
profit.</p>
<p class="stbody"><b>BRANCHES</b></p>
<p class="stbody">By 1913 when <b>Barclays Bank Limited</b> took over the <b>Simonds</b> 
interests, there were 12 branches. By today’s standards, this may not seem to 
have been a very significant expansion over nearly 100 years, but it is to be 
remembered that in those times the greater part of the country’s wealth was in 
comparatively few hands. For most country folk, the mattress or pot on the 
mantelpiece was adequate security for their meagre savings.</p>
<p class="stbody">The <b>first branch</b> was opened in 1816 only on Tuesdays at the 
Roebuck Public House, <b>Wokingham</b>, when the town held its Market. The Simonds name 
would have been well known and respected locally, as both <b>John and Charles lived 
close by at Arborfield and Sindlesham</b>. The business seems to have flourished, 
and it moved to new premises in 1855. <b>John Simonds (the second) (1807-1876)</b> 
noted the occasion in his diary as follows:</p>
<p class="stbody"><i>4<sup>th</sup> September 1855 – I rode "Blackbeard" to 
Wokingham. Withers brought the money by railway and we commenced business in the 
new shop – it is not quite complete but is very comfortable and approved of much 
by our customers.</i></p>
<p class="stbody">Five years after its first branch, in 1821 the bank opened at 
<b>Henley-on-Thames</b>, filling a gap left by the failure of the Henley and Oxford 
Bank in that year.</p>
<p class="stbody">The partners, by now all members of the Simonds family, were 
proving themselves to be sound bankers, keeping the bank’s general position 
under daily scrutiny. As a result, they weathered the financial crisis of 1825 
without undue trouble. However, annual profits were modest from the start, and 
were only around £4,000 in 1844, even though a further office had been opened in 
High Wycombe in 1841. </p>
<p class="stbody">Another branch was opened in <b>Yorktown</b> in 1863, opposite the 
Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. It operated twice a week at first, and then 
daily from 1887. This followed from a close business relationship, because W. B. 
Simonds had secured the beer contract with the Academy as far back as 1813, at 
the time that he was a brewer.</p>
<p class="stbody">No doubt some branches of the Bank were opened in places where 
the Simonds name was already well established, thanks to the sale of beer by the 
brewing side of the family. By this time, the connection between the two 
businesses was only a formal one, because inevitably the family relationship was 
becoming more remote from one generation to the next. The Basingstoke branch, 
opening in 1864, continued a link that went back to William Blackall Simonds’ 
marriage to the daughter of the Basingstoke brewer <b>Thomas May</b>.</p>
<p class="stbody">Branches followed at <b>Crowthorne</b> (early 1890’s), <b>Camberley</b> 
(1896), <b>Bracknell</b> (1899), <b>Twyford</b> (1899), <b>Caversham</b>, <b>Oxford Road, Reading</b> and
<b>Wargrave</b> (all before 1905).</p>
<p class="stbody">When Barclays Bank took over the Reading Office and these 12 
smaller branches, profits had risen to close on £25,000 in a year, and deposits 
were nearly £1 million.</p>
<p class="stbody"><b>BANKNOTES</b></p>
<p class="stbody">Private banks of the time were allowed under Licence to issue 
their own notes. Simonds took advantage of this. Each note issued was carefully 
recorded by giving it a number and entering it in a Note Book. Here is an example of a Simonds 
banknote.</p>
<p class="stbody">
<img border="0" alt="A Banknote issued by the Simonds Bank on 22nd November 1814" src  ="images/Banknote1.jpg" width=592 height=357 ></p>
<p class="stbody">In the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century a great deal of Reading’s 
trade was done in London, mainly in agricultural products of one sort or 
another, and in particular in sending malt to the large breweries. It was 
therefore necessary for Simonds Bank to appoint London agents, usually other 
bankers, at whose office their notes were payable.</p>
<p class="stbody">Country banking, in its early beginnings, was established 
within a very restricted community and customer confidence was essential if the 
banks’ notes were to be readily accepted. Simonds achieved respect by building 
up a reputation for sound management, and their notes seem to have circulated 
freely. Amazingly, two five-pound notes and a ten-pound note that dated from 
1888 - 1890 turned up again on 13<sup>th</sup> June 1932. They were presented by 
Westminster Bank Limited, Lombard Street office, to "The Local Directors, 
Barclays Bank Limited, 3, 4 &amp; 5 King Street, Reading". Even though they had 
originally been issued by "John Simonds, Charles Simonds &amp; Co., Reading Branch" 
forty years before, they were still honoured.</p>
<p class="stbody"><b>FORGERIES</b></p>
<p class="stbody">It was not uncommon for attempts to be made to forge banknotes 
even in the early days of Note Issues. Substantial rewards were offered for 
arrests and convictions. Laws were harsh in those times, and one such forger was 
executed at Newgate Prison in 1779.</p>
<p class="stbody">J<b>ohn Simonds the second (1807-1876)</b> mentioned forgery in his 
diary:</p>
<p class="stbody"><i>7<sup>th</sup> March 1848</i></p>
<p class="stbody"><i>Charles went to London on business, having heard that a party 
contemplated forging our notes and had employed a person to copy the plate. He 
set to work Forester, the officer, to find the delinquents.</i></p>
<p class="stbody"><i>23<sup>rd</sup> March 1848</i></p>
<p class="stbody"><i>Charles had gone to London to appear against some parties who 
had been attempting to forge our notes. They had applied to our engraver to copy 
our plate, but he had appeared an honest man and let us know the application. 
Charles had employed Tilliard, who had engaged Bush and Mullins, Solicitors to 
the Society of Protection of Bankers, and they very wisely set the Foresters to 
work, who managed the matters so well that I think there will be no doubt of 
their ultimate conviction.</i></p>
<p class="stbody"><i>7<sup>th</sup> April 1848</i></p>
<p class="stbody"><i>Charles went to London to prosecute forgers. The jury found a 
true Bill on Tuesday and he was ordered up to the trial today. They were 
convicted and sentenced to 10 years’ transportation each.</i></p>
<p class="stbody"><b>‘RUNS’</b></p>
<p class="stbody">Simonds Reading Bank was established in stirring times, when 
everyone and every town was being affected by the industrial revolution and the 
vast improvement in communications. Reading was well placed to enjoy this new 
prosperity.</p>
<p class="stbody">It was also a time of intensifying economic crisis when lack 
of confidence in a local country bank could result in ‘runs’ – with deposits 
being quickly withdrawn and gold being demanded for notes. Many such banks 
failed as a result. There is no evidence that the confidence in Simonds Bank 
ever resulted in a ‘run’. However, an incident in the severe financial crisis of 
1825 is worth recording. In that year, the bank was informed by its London 
Agents, Williams &amp; Co., on the afternoon of 12<sup>th</sup> December that they 
would not open their doors the next morning. Charles Simonds at once chartered a 
coach, went up to London, and at 9 o’clock the next morning had an office open 
in Birchin Lane, immediately opposite Williams Bank, with a notice posted up 
"Reading Notes paid here".</p>
<p class="stbody">The Reading Mercury (forerunner to the Reading Chronicle) 
recorded on 17<sup>th</sup> December 1825 with pleasure that all the local banks 
had proved that people could be confident of their stability. Elsewhere, 
however, no fewer than 60 Banks failed between July 1825 and June 1826.</p>
<p class="stbody"><b>FROM SMALL BEGINNINGS</b></p>
<p class="stbody">Back when W. B. Simonds formed his partnership, existing laws 
were designed to keep provincial banks small and local. There could be no more 
than six partners, and their personal wealth could be called upon to settle 
banking debts. Simonds Bank grew slowly but steadily, though by 1831 it still 
only had a capital of £4,000. Deposits from customers increased from £55,000 in 
1831 to £421,000 by 1882 and £925,000 by 1913, while capital increased to 
£30,000 in 1882, and £100,000 when Simonds merged with Barclays.</p>
<p class="stbody">Profits were relatively modest; from £2,500 in 1832, they grew 
to £23,000 by 1912, a year before the merger. This might not have provided much 
income for the partners, but we do know that they had other interests besides 
banking. <b>John Simonds the second</b> was very much concerned with <b>farming at Newlands</b>, and with 
<b>milling at Sindlesham</b>. He also helped to run <b>May’s Brewery in 
Basingstoke</b>, into which W.B. Simonds had married.</p>
<p class="stbody">It is told that, on one occasion, after hunting a deer into 
the middle of Reading, John called at the Bank to see Charles (also the second), 
who was more regularly at the Partners Desk.</p>
<p class="stbody"><b>MERGER WITH BARCLAYS</b></p>
<p class="stbody">An Act of 1826 established the principle of ‘Joint Stock 
Banking’ outside of London, which allowed <b>Messrs. Barclay and Company </b>to form a 
large organisation from 20 private banks in 1896. Barclays made repeated offers 
to merge with Simonds, and these finally bore fruit on 1<sup>st</sup> October 
1913. <b>Simonds announced the merger</b> to their Customers as follows:</p>
<p class="stbody"><i>"We have accordingly transferred our business to them, as from 
the 1<sup>st</sup> instant, but shall ourselves continue to have a direct 
connection with the business as Local Directors."</i></p>
<p class="stbody">The Local Head Office remained at the same address at 3 King 
Street, where the Simonds’ brass name-plate can still be seen.</p>
<p class="stbody"><em>[Barclays Bank moved to a new 
      office further west in Broad Street in 2011]</em>
