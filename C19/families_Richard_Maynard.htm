    <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Richard Maynard, Landlord of The Swan, 
    Arborfield, 1842 </font></b></p>
<p>I was very interested to read about The Swan at Arborfield on your website. I 
thought you might like some info on my great, great grandfather, Richard 
Maynard, who was landlord of The Swan in 1842, as given in your listing of 
former landlords. Of course, you may know all about him already! </p>
<p>An entry on your Arborfield Local History Society website, which I accessed 
in July 2007, gives the following information: </p>
<p><i><b>The earliest record discovered, so far, of the landlords of The Swan, 
can be found in Snares Directory of 1842, where a Mr Maynard is listed as 
landlord (but in the 1841 Census he was described simply as a ‘cordwinder’ 
though with three people lodging with him and his wife). I know from records 
that Elizabeth Pitcher was the licensee in 1853 when the rent was Eight guineas 
per annum (£8.40p). </b></i></p>
<p>Here is more about my ancestor and what happened to him and why he did not 
carry on as landlord for long. A <b>Thomas Chandler</b> held the post in 1847. </p>
<p>According to the 1841 census Richard Maynard was born around 1805 in Hurst, 
Sonning, Berkshire. The IGI Familysearch website states he married <b>Caroline 
Brown</b> (born c.1807) at Windlesham, Surrey, on 19 December 1831. There were 
no children of the marriage. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Caroline, died in the Oct-Dec quarter 1841 but shortly 
afterwards he remarried a <b>Harriett Greenaway</b> on 20th June 1842. The 
marriage certificate shows his occupation as <b>‘Innkeeper’ at Newland’</b>. 
Harriett was born in Sonning c.1814. Their first son <b>George</b> was born 28th 
May 1845, and his birth certificate shows the family living at Shinfield. (I am 
a direct descendant from son George). Another son <b>Richard</b> was born in 
1847 and daughter <b>Harriett</b> arrived c.1850. Sadly, Richard passed away in 
December 1850 leaving his three young children fatherless. </p>
<p>Not long afterwards, according to the 1851 Census, his widow Harriett is 
listed as <b>‘Innkeeper’ at The Black Boy, Shinfield Green</b>, near Reading, 
Berks., and has George, Richard and Harriett with her. (Son Richard emigrates to 
Texas and I have all the details of his life in the USA) </p>
<p>In June 1853 Harriett marries again, to a <b>Henry Payne</b>, a ‘brewer’s 
servant’, and they have a daughter, <b>Elizabeth</b> in 1854. </p>
<p>I hope this information will be useful for your files. I thought you might also like to see this old postcard of The Swan which I 
added to my Maynard family history files some time ago. </p>

<p>There is no publisher shown nor a date of posting. However, the
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">½</span>d stamp 
price shows it was issued prior to June 1918, as from that date the postage 
doubled to one penny. The message on the reverse is interesting but no name 
given, just <b>Will and Win</b> and the sender <b>‘LMF’</b>.</p>

<p>Dear Win,</p>
<p>This is the village about 7 miles out of Reading, where I was born. There is 
a large Military camp there now. </p>
<p>I am pleased to hear you are having your sister home a little longer, you 
will miss her a great deal. </p>
<p>What do you think of Will's photo? Kind regards to family,</p>
<p>love L.M.F.'<br>&nbsp;<img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Arborfield Local History Society has searched through the baptism 
registers for the late 1800s and the FREEBMD website. There doesn't seem to be find a match for 
the initials 'L.M.F.', or for anyone 
with the initials 'L.M.' or 'L.' who married prior to 1920 to anyone with a 
surname beginning 'F'. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">'Odi' could possibly be 'Odiham', but there is no 'Mill 
Road' in that area.&nbsp;</p>
