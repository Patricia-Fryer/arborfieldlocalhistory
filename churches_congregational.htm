        The British Legion club on Eversley Road stands on land that used to 
        hold a Congregational Chapel. We don't currently have photos of the 
        Chapel, but we do have an extract from from a book written in 1905, 
        which tells us how the Chapel came about.</p>

  <p class="stbody"><b>ARBORFIELD</b></p>
  <p class="stbody">It appears from a notice in the ‘Congregational Magazine’ 
  for 1841 that a small Congregational cause existed on this village at that 
  date, under the care of a <b><a href="churches_dissenters.htm">Mr. W. Breach</a></b>, but I have found no further trace of 
  its history.</p>
  <p class="stbody">In a series of village missions, held in 1896 under the 
  auspices of the Reading Free Churches Federation, Arborfield Cross was one of 
  the places visited. Shortly after the mission, the Federation received a 
  memori<img border="1" hspace="5" alt="The 'Free Church', on the 1930's Ordnance Survey six-inch map " vspace  =5 align=right src="images/new/OS_1930s_Centre4.jpg" width=217 height=319 >al, signed by over seventy villagers, representing that there was no 
  accommodation for Free Church worship within three miles, and asking if the 
  Federation could meet the wants. As services had previously been carried on in 
  the open air, in connection with Broad Street church, by members of its 
  Christian Endeavour Society, that church was requested by the Federation to 
  undertake the work.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The request was acceded to, and a timber-built chapel, which 
  had been used for private services in a neighbouring village, was purchased 
  and re-erected at Arborfield, at a cost of £380. It was opened on the Bank 
  Holiday in August 1899, when a service was preached by the Rev. Dr. Glover, of 
  Bristol. Several members of the federation, representing various sections of 
  the Free Churches, contributed liberally to its funds, and the services are 
  attended by worshippers of several denominations. </p>

  <p class="stbody">Kelly's Directory noted that the Congregational Chapel was 
  opened in 1899, and that it could seat 200 people (as compared with 220 at St. 
  Bartholomew's). </p>
  <p class="stbody">By the 1939 Directory, the building was listed as the 
  'Salvation Army Hall, erected in 1899, seating 200 people', with no mention of 
  its Congregational origins.</p>

  News' carried the following item:&nbsp; </p>

  <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">The first Salvation Army wedding to be held in 
  the village took place in the Army Hall on Saturday, when <b>Miss Freda M. P. 
  Devereux</b>, eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. Devereux of Council Houses, 
  Barkham, was married to Mr. <b>William L. Jones</b>, eldest son of Mr. and 
  Mrs. L. T. Jones, of Dowlais, South Wales. The bridegroom, who returned in 
  December from Canada where he had been farming, has been a member of the 
  Salvation Army for thirteen years, and his wife for two. They are both 
  well-known in Barkham, and have been associated with open-air services in the 
  district.</span></p>
  <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">The bride was married in uniform, wearing a 
  white sash and a white carnation, and her maid of honour, Mrs. West, was 
  attired in a grey costume. <b>Captain M. Kernaghan</b>, the Commandant, conducted the 
  ceremony, and Mr. F. Field acted as best man. Among the guests at the 
  reception, which was held in the hall, was Mrs. Warren (the bridegroom’s 
  sister), who had been married a few hours earlier at Crowborough, Sussex.</span></p>

  Provisional Valuation of the Congregational Chapel, Arborfield</b>, in the

  <p>Nearly two decades later, there was a letter from the solicitors to <b>Dr.

  29<sup>th</sup> March 1965. It mentioned the sale of the Chapel to the <b>

  Hampton</b> to <b>M. Attwood</b>, treasurer. The proceeds were invested. The 
  letter mentioned the Broad Street Chapel Trustees.</p>
  <p>A further letter from Brain &amp; Brain to <b>C G Shorter</b> of Upper Woodcote 
  Road, Caversham RG4 7HJ, dated 26<sup>th</sup> March 1969, confirmed that the 
  Trustees of Broad Street Chapel, even though they weren’t the original 
  Trustees, had the power to decide how to deal with the proceeds of the sale 
  back in 1946. Among others, they provided financial help to congregations at
  <b>Rokeby Hall</b> and at <b>Grange Free Church, Southcote</b>. Final 
  correspondence in the file was a set of letters from the main recipients, 
  thanking the <b>Broad Street Trustees</b>.</p>
