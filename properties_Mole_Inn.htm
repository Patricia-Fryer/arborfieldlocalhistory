        The <b>Mole Inn</b> has been a private house since  1956. It is 
        now known as <b>Argyll House</b>, and it 
        appeared in the news in recent years after three cars hit the wall in 
        the same frosty morning.&nbsp;  </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" alt="Argyll House, which ceased to be the 'Mole Inn' during 1956" src  ="images/Mole_Inn.jpg" width=490 height=355 ></p>

        <p class="stbody">There is evidence that the 'Mole' was an inn before 
        1765, when <b>Edward Savage</b> took the tenancy from <b>Henry Coles</b>. 
        It had been tied to the <b>Simonds</b> brewery since at least 1802 when
        <b>William Blackall Simonds</b> bought the inn and its land from <b>
        Sander Willson</b> of Swallowfield and his wife <b>Elizabeth</b> (née <b>
        Allwright</b>, from Arborfield). </p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><a href="properties_Pride_Map.htm">Thomas Pride's 
        Map of 1790</a></b> shows that there were many more cottages near to the
        <b>'Mole'</b> at that time. On the portion of the map shown below, <b>
        Carter's Hill</b> is at the top, and <b>Arborfield Cross</b> is at the 
        bottom. <b>Church Lane</b> is off to the left, two-thirds down. However, 
        the present-day <b>Mole Road</b> didn't seem to exist (it was probably 
        created when <b>Bearwood Mansion</b> was built in the 1800s). Instead, 
        the track across <b>'Barewood Common'</b> passed to the north of what's 
        now known as <b>'Cordery Cottage'</b> and continued to the south-west 
        along a lane that has long since disappeared. It emerged at <b>Church 
        Lane</b> by <b>Reading Room Cottage</b> (which didn't exist in 1790). 
        There were several more cottages at <b>Hughes Green</b> than exist 
        today. At the bottom right of this map is <b>Langley Pond Farm</b>.

        <p class="stbody">In Victorian times and until the 1940s, the 'Mole' 
        largely served the domestic staff of the <b>Simonds family</b> (the banking 
        branch, not the brewers) 
        who lived nearby at '<a href="A_N_1947_01c.htm"><b>Newlands</b>'</a>, 
        plus the staff of the <b>Walter family</b> at <b>Bearwood</b>.&nbsp; See the <b>
        <a href="BW_Hurst_C2.htm">Bearwood Estate map</a></b> for its location. 
        It was often the start-point for the Garth Hunt, as typified in a report 
        in the 'Reading Mercury' of 20th February 1897:</p>

        <font style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">
        <p><i><b>HUNTING NOTES: MR. GARTH’S.</b> 10<sup>th</sup> – <b>The Mole, 
        Sindlesham</b>. Larger field out. Found a leash in <b>Carters-hill</b>, 
        the property of that great sportsman, <b>Mr. Jas. Simonds</b>. Hounds 
        settled down to one and drove him at a cracking pace to <b>Arborfield 
        Hall </b>and on to <b>Moor Copse</b>, where he swung left-handed to <b>
        Brick-hill</b> over the hill to <b>Wivells</b>, passing on to <b>
        Bramshill-common</b>, where hounds threw up and could do no more with 
        this good fox after a good 40 minutes. Found again in <b>Foxhills</b>, 
        running at a rare pace over the open to <b>Longmore-bog</b>, turning 
        left over the Wokingham road and on to <b>the Ridges</b>, where a lot of 
        tussling hunting hounds had to be stopped, as horses were dead beat.</i></p>
        </font>

        <p class="stbody">Here is a postcard view of the building when it was a public 
        house.</p>

        <img border="0" alt="The Mole Inn, Sindlesham Road" src  ="images/Mole1.jpg" width=489 height=322 ></p>

        <p class="stbody">Here's a close-up of the writing on the wall of the 
        lean-to extension; the 
        'Mole' was in the business of providing teas as well as beer (see 
        the 'Swan' Tea-Garden <b><a href="properties_swan_1930s.htm">here</a></b>).</p>

        <p class="stbody">

        <p class="stbody">
        Unlike the 'Swan' and 'Bramshill Hunt' in Arborfield which changed hands 
        every few years, the 'Mole' remained in the hands of very few families 
        for nearly a century:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        According to Deeds from 1807 now in Berkshire Record Office, the tenant 
        was <b>'Thomas Mileman'</b>. </p>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        The 1841 Census shows that <b>Samuel Mileham</b> was Landlord, and he 
        combined inn-keeping with carpentry to supplement his income. Was he 
        related to Thomas? The surnames look very similar, and a 'Thomas Mileham' 
        was buried at Hurst in 1814, 'aged 55'.</p>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        The <b><a href="C19/families_Pub_landlords_1815.htm">September 1815 
        Quarter Sessions for the Forest Division of Berkshire </a></b>name <b>
        <a name="Samuel_Milam">Samuel Milam</a></b> as a 'Victualler' in the parish of Hurst. </p>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        By 1851, <b>John Giles</b> had taken over.</p>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        <b>Thomas Dickens</b> was Landlord (and also a shoemaker) for several 
        years, being first recorded in the 1861 Census and still there in 1881. </p>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        <b>George Kennard<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, from Hastings in 
        Sussex, </span></b>was Landlord from at least 1889 until his death in 
        1900. His widow <b>Ann</b>, who hailed from Stanford Dingley, took over 
        for another three years until her death in August 1903, aged 67. </p>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        <b>George Henry Newman</b> is known to have been Landlord since at least 
        1911 until some time during the 1920s when his wife <b>Louisa</b> took 
        over until the early 1930s.</p>
          <li>

        <p class="stbody">
        The 1933 Electoral Register lists <b>Alex Walter Adams</b> and <b>
        Gertrude Louisa Adams</b> as residents, and the 1935 Kelly's Directory 
        states that <b>Alex</b> is the Landlord, though by December 1934, he had 
        died and a new Tenancy Agreement had been signed with his widow. In 1939, the Landlady 
        is <b>'Mrs. Fanny Adams'</b>, though the Electoral Registers of 1939, 
        1946 and 1950 still list her first names as <b>'Gertrude Louisa'</b>. 
        She re-married on 29th March 1952, to <b>Gerald Lawtey</b>; by 1960, 
        they had moved to 2 Brook Cottages in Hughes Green.&nbsp; </p>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="stbody">
        In 1945, former members of the <b><a href="C20/memories_Home_Guard.htm">
        Home Guard</a></b> formed the <b>Newland (H.G.) Rifle Club</b> at the 
        'Mole'.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <b>Reg Cordery</b>, who lived next door to the 'Mole' at <b>'The Glen' 
        <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">(now</span> 'Cordery 
        Cottage'<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">)</span> </b>has kindly provided an aerial photo of the two properties 
        from around the 1940's, plus photos of the <b>Darts Team</b>. </p>
