Here are a few selections from the 30-article <b>‘Hunting in Berkshire’ </b>series by <b>
<a href="families_Cope.htm">J. Hautenville Cope</a></b>, published in the 
‘Reading Mercury’ from February to December 1921, plus a couple of items showing 
how hunting was covered during 1921.
<p><b>Extract from Article 3</b>, published March 5<sup>th</sup>:</p>
<p><i>[…] At first, during the lifetime of his father, <b>Mr. Chute</b> had a 
pack of harriers, though according to old accounts he was not above hunting a 
fox with his hare hounds. After succeeding to the estate in 1791 he changed to 
foxhounds, and remained in office until his death in 1824. <b>Mr. Austin-Lee</b> 
in that most interesting, but very scarce, book, "The Vine Hunt", for it was 
printed for private circulation, remarks that Mr. Chute "for a few seasons did 
occupy a country <b>eastward of the Loddon towards Hartley Row</b>. I do not 
know how far he went in that direction." </i></p>
<p><i>From the papers referred to in the previous article I am enabled to 
supplement the information given by the author of <b>"The Vine Hunt"</b>. I find 
that Mr. Chute hunted the country <b>north of the river Blackwater and south of 
Wokingham</b>, for on the 9<sup>th</sup> January, 1792, that is his first 
season, he "found in <b>Loddon Bridge covert</b> and went away instantly in good 
style through <b>Sinsom [Sindlesham]</b>, <b>Newland</b>, <b>Arborfield</b>, <b>
Moor Copse</b>, <b>Swallowfield Park over Farley Hill</b>, to <b>Four Hurdles</b>, 
where, heading, he returned through the chain of coverts to <b>Swallowfield Park</b>, 
and stood indebted for his escape to the great number of hares which were 
constantly in view. </i></p>
<p><i>A brace of foxes were soon unkennelled in <b>Wyfields</b>, but the hounds 
dividing, a want of combined force became too perceptible to render killing a 
matter of ease at the very late hour of the day". West of the Loddon he hunted
<b>Pinge Wood</b>, <b>Sulhamstead</b>, where he had a strong supporter in <b>Mr. 
William Thoyts</b>. From the time he started the Vine Hounds, and for some 
seasons afterwards, Mr. Chute was frequently in the northern part of the 
country.</i></p>
<p><i>[…] </i></p>
<p><b>Article 6</b>, from March 26th, mentioned <b>Sir John Cope</b> and the 
Bramshill Hunt.</p>
<p><b><a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire_07.htm">Article 7</a></b>, published on April 2<sup>nd</sup>, went into considerable detail 
on negotiations to take over part of <b>Bramshill Hunt</b> country in 1850. Read the 
details <b><a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire_07.htm">here</a></b>.</p>
<p><b><a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire_08.htm">Article 8</a></b>, from April 9<sup>th</sup>, described further meetings held at the 
Bear Hotel in Reading, correspondence and the challenge of a duel, and can be 
seen in detail <b><a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire_08.htm">here</a></b>.</p>
<p><b><a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire_09.htm">Article 9</a></b> gave a useful summary of the story so far: </p>
<p><i>It may be that some of my readers have missed a few of the previous articles. 
For their benefit I will here briefly repeat events and dates. Sir John Cope 
took the hounds 1817; in 1843 the country was divided and the South Berks Hunt 
organised, with <b>Mortimer George Thoyts</b> as Master. He resigned in 1847, when 
<b>G. 
H. Montagu, of Caversham Hill</b>, became Master. </i> </p>
<p><i><b>Sir John Cope</b> gave up his hounds in 1850; at the same time <b>Mr. Montagu</b> 
retired from the mastership of the South Berks, and both countries were united 
under <b>Mr. J. J. Wheble</b>. </i> </p>
<p><i>In 1852 the united country once more was divided, <b>Mr. Garth</b> taking the east 
side of the River Loddon, the <b>South Berks</b> the other or west side, with <b>Mr. Wheble</b> as Master.’ 
</i>Full details of Article 9, published on April 23<sup>rd</sup>, 
can be seen <b><a href="memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire_09.htm">here</a></b>.</p>
<p><b>Article 30</b>, the last in the ‘Hunting in Berkshire’ series, was published on 
Christmas Eve, in good time for the traditional Boxing Day hunt.</p>
<p>On October 29th 1921, a correspondent named <b>
<a href="memories_wryneck.htm">‘Wryneck’</a></b> started contributing 
<b>‘Hunting Notes’</b> on the week’s hunt meetings. The armchair hunt follower could 
trace the progress of each hunt with the aid of a map; a typical example was 
published on November 26<sup>th</sup> 1921:</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Garth Hunt at Newlands.</font></b></p>
<p>"On Saturday the meet was at <b>Newlands</b>. Going into <b>Barkham Coombs</b> hounds found 
their first fox after 10 minutes’ drawing. There was such a cry, and they sent 
through cover at such a pace that there seemed every hope for a good scenting 
day. But it was not to be. The fox must have been lying close and only moved 
when hounds came up to him, for very soon scent began to fail, and it turned out 
about the worst scenting day for many a week.</p>
<p>"The morning’s work in the <b>Coombs</b> 
is hard to describe. There were several foxes afoot and a large following of 
foot people to view them, with the consequence that <i><b>view holloas</b></i> sounded by the 
dozen from every part of the Coombs. Foxes could not get away, and hounds with 
no good line to hold them were confused by the shouting and inclined to get 
their heads up. After doing everything possible, the Master, hunting a cold 
line, went across into <b>Bear Wood</b>. Here, too, there were several foxes, but not 
an atom of scent. Eventually a fox went away as though for the <b>Holt</b>, but turning 
short back into covert, hounds overran him. Presently, being viewed again, 
hounds went to the <i><b>holloa</b></i> and again overran him in the direction of 
<b>Bottle 
Copse</b>. Being so close to this covert, they were thrown in and another fox went 
away, pointing for <b>East Heath</b>. Running parallel with <b>Evendon’s Lane</b>, they just 
managed to hunt the line for a short mile and then lost him. Hunting without 
scent being an impossibility, they went home at 2:45 p.m."</p>
<p>On December 31<sup>st</sup>, ‘Wryneck’ gave the following advice to those 
following the hunt on foot rather than from their armchairs:</p>
<p><i>"<b>ADVICE GRATIS</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>"<b>To Motorists</b> – Although you may be the largest subscribers to the hunt (or 
perhaps subscribe not at all), curb your fiery steeds when hounds are drawing, 
and let not your engines run alongside covert. Foxes probably object strongly to 
a noisy engine, and are unlikely to break in face of a raging petrol fiend.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>"<b>To Push-bike and Foot Followers</b> – Remember that (with few exceptions) you 
don’t pay one cent for your sport. You are getting a lot of fun at other 
people’s expense. Try therefore to repay the obligation by helping as much as 
you can; do not get round covert and <b>holloa</b> in the face of a breaking fox; do 
not get in the way of the hounds and hunt servants or mounted field; and, when 
you have seen no fox or when hounds are running well, do not mislead the 
huntsman by <b>view holloas</b>, however tuneful, merely to show you can do it better 
than the other chap.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>"Never <b>holloa</b> unless you see a fox yourself. Take nobody else’s word for it. 
If you do, you may find yourself <b>holloaing </b>a hare and get the blame; and serve 
you ---- well right."</i></p>
