  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">'An Everyday Story of Country Folk' . . .</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">There is a Minute Book of <b>Arborfield Parochial Church 
  Council</b> covering the period from 1935 to 1954, during which period there were 
  major changes in the life of the village.&nbsp; The Second World War brought its 
  own changes and the Post-war period changed people's aspirations; meanwhile, 
  these and other pressure caused the estates of Arborfield Hall and Newlands to 
  be broken up. This trawl through the Minute-Book identifies the key figures 
  and issues raised over this period.</p>
  <p class="stbody"><i>The Parochial Church Council is the governing body of 
  the church. It has no formal connection with the Parish Council,&nbsp; though there 
  have been members serving on both at the same time, and Canon Anderson chaired 
  both for many years.</i></p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1935</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The Annual Meeting of the PCC for 1935 was held on 10th 
  March in the relatively new <b>Village Hall,</b> which confusingly is situated in 
  what was the civil Parish of Newland and the ecclesiastical Parish of Bearwood.&nbsp; 
  At that time, the Electoral Roll stood at 155.&nbsp; Who were the elected members 
  of the PCC?</p>
  <p class="stbody"><b>Canon Joshua Anderson</b> - Rector<br>
  <b>Mr Bowyer</b> and <b>Mr Carter</b> - Churchwardens<br>
  <b>Mr and Mrs Carter, Miss Bentham</b> and <b>Mrs Guy Bentley</b> - 
  Representatives on the 'Ruridecanal Conference' (that is, the governors of the 
  Rural Deanery of Sonning)<br>
  Messrs. <b>Allsebrook, Allen, Guy Bentley, Barker, R Brean, 
  Cox, Simonds, Thomas, Verrall</b>; Mrs. <b>Anderson, Williamson, Prescott, Lyford, 
  Smith</b>; Misses <b>Jervoise, Druett</b> and <b>A M Edwards </b>- PCC Members.</p>
  <p class="stbody">Subsequent PCC meetings were also held in the Village 
  Hall, and at the first, on May 1st, <b>Miss Simonds</b> was co-opted as a member. The 
  usual business was finance (annual expenditure was around £200), and 
  maintenance of both the church building and the forms of worship, with prayer normally minuted at some stage in the proceedings.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; 
  the big discussion this time was about a service to take place on <b>Jubilee 
  Sunday</b>, May 12th. A Legion Parade was to take place in the evening, plus a 
  short service on the Sports Ground. Later that year, the PCC discussed plans 
  for a Senior Church School to be built in Wokingham.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1936</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The next year PCC was concerned about the state of the <b>Old 
  Church and Churchyard</b>, which was far from satisfactory. The <b>Berks 
  Archaeological Society</b> had suggested and recommended certain repairs to 
  preserve the ruins at a cost of about £70 - which was beyond the means of the PCC.&nbsp; They decided to approach the Local Authorities for help.&nbsp; A later 
  meeting agreed that the ivy should be trimmed and certain repairs done.</p>
  <p class="stbody">Also in 1936, <b>Miss Vincent</b>'s offer to provide a stained 
  glass window in memory of her parents. This was accepted, and the PCC agreed 
  the precise form of words necessary to obtain a 'faculty' from the Diocese to 
  have the works completed. </p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1937</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The Old Church continued to occupy the PCC's agenda in 
  1937. They made a claim to the Parish Council for £3 for maintenance while 
  more long-term plans were being drawn up. Another big occasion was special 
  services for the <b>Coronation</b>, including a short service on the Sports Field.</p>
  <p class="stbody">
  <a href="images/New_Church_Inside1.jpg">
  <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Looking towards the Chancel of the new church" align   =left src="images/Thumb/New_Church_Inside1.jpg" width=264 height=197 ></a><b>Mrs Williamson</b> had offered to install electric light in 
  the Chancel as a Coronation gift. Power was to be by portable batteries, which 
  presented a practical problem - how to transport the batteries and charge 
  them?&nbsp; Meanwhile, at the Old Church, <b>Mr Allsebrook</b> reported that trees on his 
  property had broken the wall round the Churchyard, and he sought permission to 
  lower the wall in repair.</p>
  <p class="stbody">By October, a more immediate threat was woodworm in the 
  Organ; both the manuals and the frame were affected, and so these needed 
  complete replacement, including keyboards. At the same time, <b>Mr T H Allen</b>, who 
  had been Organist and Choirmaster for 25 years, felt he should resign because 
  of his health and increasing years. Over at the Old Church, the wall had been 
  lowered, while an estimate had been received for necessary repairs to the Old 
  Church. The mortuary chapel was in a bad state, and the Hargreaves family were 
  to be advised of the proposed demolition. </p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1938</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">By February 1938, the Church building had been improved 
  by the repairs to the Organ at £43, a new carpet in the Chancel donated by <b>Mrs 
  Prescott</b> and the electric lighting in the Chancel. A new Organist and 
  Choirmaster had been appointed, namely <b>Mr G St Clare Collis</b>. Looking outwards, 
  a new Missionary Committee was formed.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1939</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">In 1939, a Faculty had been obtained to transfer the 
  Standen Monument and Tablet from the Old Church. Mr Collis reported on the 
  condition of the Organ, which he felt would need to be completely rebuilt 
  within a few years. The Council was asked its opinion whether the Choir should 
  sit in the Chancel rather than in the Nave, but this was deemed to be 
  difficult both because of the size of the Choir, and because of the acoustics 
  in the Chancel.</p>
  <p class="stbody"><b>Mr J A H Simonds</b> had taken on the role of Churchwarden 
  and Treasurer some years before, after Mr Carter had left the Parish. Now it 
  was Mr Simond's turn to move away, and his position was filled by Mr J H 
  Simonds.&nbsp; Although there was no mention of the impending War, a letter was 
  read at the meeting on February 15th 1939 from the Bishop, asking whether 
  people could offer temporary accommodation to one or more refugee Jewish 
  children from Germany. However, the PCC didn't feel that they were able to 
  help in this way.</p>
  <p class="stbody">Reports had been received from various Organ builders - 
  Walkers, Willis, Gray &amp; Dawson and Hill's - concerning repairs.&nbsp; All mentioned 
  dry rot and woodworm. The Organ was past repair, but the pipes and some of the 
  stops could be salvaged, Rebuilding would cost around £1000.&nbsp; Woodworm had 
  also infected joists under the floor where the Standen Monument was to be 
  sited, plus another area that was inspected. Over at the Old Church, 
  Wokingham RDC had pointed out that Arborfield Parish Council was responsible 
  for the care of the Old Churchyard, and were undertaking repairs to the 
  boundary wall.</p>
  <p class="stbody">At the 1939 Annual Church Meeting, Canon Anderson 
  reported that the Afternoon Sunday School had been discontinued due to lack of 
  helpers, but the Morning Sunday School was being continued with Miss Jervoise 
  and Miss Mary Simonds as teachers in place of Mrs Anderson and Miss Bentham. 
  Numbers at both the morning and evening congregations were declining. </p>
  <p class="stbody">The April meeting reported a deficit in funds, which put 
  everything on hold. The Church Floor was not in immediate danger, so work was 
  deferred. Also, although the Reading Mercury had reported that the Berks 
  Archaeological Society's recommended action on the Old Church was due to take 
  place, this wasn't the case because there were no funds available. As it was, 
  Mr Allsebrook at Arborfield Hall asked whether he could remove some trees in 
  the Old Churchyard and the income from the timber would pay for repairing the 
  boundary wall; the PCC agreed. In the new Churchyard, the recent extension was 
  to be subject to Tithe apportionment, which the PCC couldn't afford.</p>
  <p class="stbody">By July,&nbsp; a special fund for rebuilding the Organ that 
  John Simonds had primed with a donation of £100 had by then reached £455. The 
  PCC debated the experimental siting of the Choir in the Chancel, but a 
  majority preferred them to move back to the body of the church. The first hint 
  that the <b>Army Technical School </b>had arrived at the Garrison was the PCC's offer 
  to lend the School an old <b>Lectern</b> that was in the <b>Reading Room</b>.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1940</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The War then intervened, and there was no meeting until 
  March 1940. The Organ fund was not as large as previously reported, because 
  provisional offers had later to be withdrawn due to the effect of the War. 
  The Parish was unable to meet its full Quota payment to the Diocese, and only 
  £16 out of £25 had been paid. The PCC proposed a vote of thanks to Col. Hood (C.R.E.) 
  for his kindness in having the Electric Light batteries charged at Arborfield 
  Grange. </p>
  <p class="stbody">The Minutes of the Annual Parish Meeting at the Village 
  Hall on March 28th 1940 gives a pen picture of life in the village with troops 
  now stationed in the area. Church funds had been affected by some subscribers 
  passing away and others moving away from the parish. Mr Allsebrook had 
  resigned his long-standing Vice-Chairmanship of the PCC because he had moved 
  away, while Mrs Stuart Rickman and Mr T H Allen had died. The Electoral Roll 
  was now 142.</p>
  <p class="stbody">There was a change of venue in May 1940, to the 
  <b>Arborfield Schools</b>. Mr Bowyer had resigned as Churchwarden because he had to 
  move away from the parish, and was replaced by Mr Verrall. New blood had 
  arrived in the form of Capt. Peele and Mrs Newton, who were co-opted to the 
  PCC.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1941</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">By 1941 the presence of the Army had boosted the 
  Electoral Roll to 172. Practical matters included the donation of a stirrup 
  pump by Mrs Prescott to deal with incendiary attacks on the church building. 
  The Rector proposed making a photographic survey of the church interior in 
  case of possible damage.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1942</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">It appears that there were no PCC meetings between April 
  1941 and March 1942. The April Annual Meeting thanked Mr George Bentley for 
  re-charging the Electric Light batteries for free. They were now 5 years old, 
  and in a poor state. New PCC members were Major Morris and Mrs Roche, and a 
  very short PCC meeting followed the Annual Church Meeting, to cut formalities 
  to the minimum.</p>
  <p class="stbody"><b><font size="4">1943</font></b></p>
  <p class="stbody">The same streamlining happened at the next PCC, which 
  followed the 1943 Annual Church Meeting.&nbsp; The church was doing good work in 
  the Schools, and in addition, the Sunday School was thriving, led by Mrs Roche 
  with Miss Jervoise and Mrs Cox. The Old Church was suffering from burglary and 
  theft; most of the panelling of the Conroy Chapel had been removed. To prevent 
  further theft, the old Communion Rails and other woodwork had been taken to 
  the Rectory for safety. </p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1944</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The next PCC was after the 1944 Annual Church Meeting.&nbsp; 
  By this time, the funds were in a satisfactory state. The Minutes were unusual 
  in listing all PCC members and Sidesmen in full rather than 'en block' as 
  reported for several years previously.</p>
  <p class="stbody"><b>John Simonds</b> and <b>Mr Verrall </b>- Churchwardens;<br>
  <b>Mr Verrall</b>, <b>Mrs Guy Bentley</b>, <b>Miss Jervoise</b>, <b>Miss A M 
  Edwards</b> - Lay Representatives on the Ruridecanal Conference;<br>
  Messrs. <b>Ayres, Guy Bentley, W Cox, G Collis, J Hunt, J 
  Watts, Major Morris</b>; Mrs <b>Aitchison, Hunt, Moore, Newton,</b> <b>Prescott, Roche, Simonds, Vickers</b>; 
  <b>Miss L Hainworth</b> - PCC members;<br>
  Messrs. <b>A Garrett, P Druett, Guy Bentley, F Edwards, P 
  Mattingley, S Emblen, F Middleton, P Ayres, J Hunt, W Balcombe, J Watts, A 
  Chambers</b> and <b>T H Clark</b> - Sidesmen.</p>
  <p class="stbody">John Simonds was Vice-Chairman, but his long-standing 
  wish to give up being Treasurer due to many extra duties was finally granted; 
  Mrs Prescott took over. Miss A M Edwards continued to serve as Secretary.</p>
  <p class="stbody">By Autumn 1944, things were easing up, and there was a 
  second PCC meeting, held in the Village Hall. The Chairman reported on the 
  deficiency of the lighting in the church, and thanked an anonymous&nbsp; friend for 
  repairing and charging three batteries. Looking towards the Post-War period, 
  an 'Organ Renewal Fund' was proposed.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1945</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The Annual Church Meeting in April 1945 reviewed the 
  pattern of services, including maintenance of Evening Services throughout the 
  winter <i>(had these been curtailed because of black-out restrictions?)</i>, and 
  inclusion of A.R.P. workers among those marching at Parade services. Mr 
  Simonds reviewed conditions in the East end of the churchyard, where some 
  trees needed to be removed and many graves were neglected. It was proposed to 
  level the neglected graves to ease maintenance.&nbsp; Canon Anderson expressed 
  thanks to many members of the Council and the Church, including Mrs Roche,&nbsp; 
  who had left the area. Mrs Elliot took over the Sunday School, while at the 
  other end of the parish, Mrs Hall had started a Sunday School at her house. 
  Finally, the meeting was told that Canon Anderson planned to retire, after 
  being in post for nearly half a century. </p>
  <p class="stbody">
  <img border="0" alt="The Churchyard from the East, showing the graves to be levelled" src  ="images/Churchyard_from_east.jpg" width=504 height=349 ></p>
  <p class="stbody">For a change, the PCC meeting took place on a different 
  day, 11th May, and a different venue, at the Schools. No mention was made of the 
  War, but of course its ending was a major reason for Canon Anderson retiring 
  at a watershed in the life of both the Church and the School.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The June meeting drew up a representation to the Patron 
  of the Living, <b>Rev. Buttle</b>, in these terms:  </p>
  <p class="stbody" align="center"><i><b>"It is the earnest wish of the 
  members of the PCC that whoever is appointed to fill the vacancy on the 
  resignation of the Rev. Canon J A Anderson shall be primarily a moderate 
  churchman, neither extreme high or low, and a married man under forty years of 
  age if possible. He should be a countryman who will understand and appreciate 
  country pursuits and interests; one who is definitely interested in the Youth 
  Movement, and will be able to take an active part in the social activities 
  associated with village life. He should be capable of teaching Religious 
  subjects in the school, and possess a good ear for music".</b></i></p>
  <p class="stbody">The July meeting discussed the year's Post War Appeal, 
  and decided to aim to install electric lighting in the Rectory. No new 
  Incumbent had been found, the biggest drawback apparently being the large and 
  inconvenient Rectory. </p>
  <p class="stbody">A special PCC meeting was called for September 21st to 
  discuss a presentation to <b>Canon Anderson</b> of a wireless set; other money raised 
  going to be spent on beautifying the interior of the church. <b>Mr Stephen Emblen</b>, 
  the oldest parishioner and church worker, would make the presentation. A 
  Ladies' Committee was appointed to arrange for refreshments. </p>
  <p class="stbody">Another PCC meeting followed on November 21st to discuss 
  the 'Canon Anderson Fund' to beautify the church. <b>Frederick Etchells</b>, 
  F.R.I.B.A., presented his proposals, which were agreed as follows:</p>
  <p class="stbody">1&nbsp; To remove the organ from its present position in the 
  Chancel and erect a new one on the West End Arch.</p>
  <p class="stbody">2&nbsp; To utilise the space gained by enlarging the Vestry.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p class="stbody">3&nbsp; To raise the Altar.</p>
  <p class="stbody">4&nbsp; To utilise the old Altar Rails from the Old Church.</p>
  <p class="stbody">5&nbsp; To remove the bands of texts over the arches and 
  windows.</p>
  <p class="stbody">6&nbsp; The installation of Electric Light when available.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1946</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The PCC met again on February 14th 1946 to hear that a 
  Faculty was being raised to deal with the proposed changes to the Church. 
  Also, the living had been offered to Rev. W Lindsay, and a reply was awaited.&nbsp; 
  The PCC proposed to install Mains water and electricity for the Rectory. </p>
  <p class="stbody">The 1946 Annual Meeting heard a proposal to divide the 
  Rectory into two dwellings in order to make it more attractive for a new 
  incumbent.&nbsp; More PCC members had left the parish, and Mrs Moore, Mrs Roche, 
  Mrs Elliott and Miss Hainworth were replaced by <b>Mr P Druett, Miss Hall, Mrs 
  Edwards</b> and <b>Mrs Watts</b>.</p>
  <p class="stbody"> </p>
  <p class="stbody">By September 18th, the new incumbent <b>Rev. Claude Sparshott</b> had been appointed. The PCC 
  first recorded:</p>
  <p class="stbody" align="center"><i><b>"the tremendous loss the Church 
  and Village had sustained through the death of Mr John Simonds - he had given 
  so much of his time and energy to the affairs of the Church and Council, that 
  one felt the loss was irreparable, but he would be remembered for the 
  invaluable services he had rendered to the Church and parish"</b></i>.  </p>
  <p class="stbody">They stood in 
  silence, after which they were able to record their welcome to the new Rector, 
  who was to be Inducted on the 25th, and to plan the finer details of this 
  Service. Another member was departing the parish: Mrs Prescott had been 
  Treasurer, and she handed over to Miss Jervoise.</p>
  <p class="stbody">After the Induction, there was another PCC meeting in 
  November, when it was proposed to sell the Rectory and build a smaller one as 
  soon as an opportunity arose. The Churchwardens had already signed up to the 
  'K2' scheme whereby the Parish topped-up the Rector's stipend by £50 a year, 
  and this was ratified. </p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1947</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The 1947 Annual Church Meeting elected <b>Brigadier E W 
  Chadwick</b> as a new Churchwarden alongside <b>
  <a href="C20/families_Verrall.htm">Mr Verrall</a></b>, though the Verralls were 
  themselves about to move out of the parish, and a replacement would be needed 
  soon. The meeting heard about progress in providing electricity and mains 
  water for the Rectory. The electrical supply had been fitted in such a way 
  that the building could be split into two dwellings. The requirements of the 
  new Education Act meant that £2520 needed to be spent on the schools over the 
  next 8 years. The Old Church was in a very bad state, and would fall into 
  decay unless something was done to preserve it.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1948</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The 1948 Annual Church Meeting revealed new plans for the 
  Organ.&nbsp; The Standen Tomb had originally been placed under the Bell Tower, and 
  it was proposed to move it to where the Sexton's seat was located to make room 
  for the Organ.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="stbody">By June 1948, the PCC heard that Major and the Misses 
  Simonds had paid for the Altar Rail to be installed, and that they wished to 
  provide a new Altar complete with three frontals. The Wooden Font from the Old 
  Church was being repaired for new use. Bearing in mind the impending heavy 
  expenditure over the next few years, Mrs Simonds didn't think that this was 
  the time to be thinking of a new pulpit, and the money should be diverted to 
  paying for moving the Organ and the Wooden Font. The PCC also proposed to 
  erect a memorial tablet to the Simonds family of Newlands who had been 
  connected with the parish for about 600 years.</p>
  <p class="stbody">At a special meeting in August to approve the wording of 
  the Simonds' memorial tablet, mention was also made of a request by the 
  <b>Ancient Order of Druids</b> to hold their annual service at the Church on October 
  3rd. [This was a <b>Friendly Society</b> and not a separate religion!]</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1949</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The February 1949 meeting heard about the state of the 
  Old Church. The chapels were to be demolished but the memorial tablets were to 
  be preserved. In the new church, the old Stone Font was to be left in place 
  even though the Wooden Font would be used instead.</p>
  <p class="stbody">At the Annual Meeting, Percy Druett retired from being 
  leader in the Bell Tower, and Stanley Day would take his place. Even though 
  there was only one change on the PCC, nevertheless the Minute Book recorded 
  the complete list of names:</p>
  <p class="stbody"><b>Mr Watts</b> and <b>Brig. Chadwick</b> - Churchwardens;<br>
  <b>Mr Watts, Mrs Vickers, Mrs Guy Bentley, Miss Jervoise</b> - 
  Ruri-decanal Conference;<br>
  Messrs. <b>Ayres, Guy Bentley,&nbsp; Andrew, Cox, Collis, Druett, 
  Hunt</b>; Mrs <b>Aitchison, Ayres, Bentley, Capper, Day, Edwards</b>,<b> Hunt, Hall, Gutteridge, Simonds, Newton, Vickers, Watts</b>; Miss
  <b>Jervoise, Edwards</b> - PCC.<br>
  <p class="stbody">When the opportunity presented itself, the Church and 
  Organ would be electrified; the Organ had been moved and it was now most 
  satisfactory.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1950</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The Old Churchyard was a sore point at the 1950 Annual 
  Church Meeting. Apparently, residents of the <b>
  <a href="properties_hall_squatters.htm">camp</a></b> in the vicinity of the Old 
  Church were causing destruction to graves and stones. However, since the camp 
  would soon be closed, the problem would soon go away <i>&nbsp;[there were lines of Nissen Huts on either side of the approach road from Church Lane to the Old 
  Church, and many of the inhabitants moved to the new 'Newland; estate when it 
  was completed. The roads were to be named after Canon Anderson and Stephen 
  Emblen]</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCC had received authority to demolish the Old Church, but 
  nothing was to be done before taking advice from the Church Architect, <b>Mr Ravenscroft</b>.</p>
  <p class="stbody">PCC meetings during the year dealt with electrification 
  of the Church and also the possibility of connecting to Mains Water, but in 
  the event the existing pump was repaired instead. The Magazine was losing 
  money, and it was proposed to have the local news typed rather than type-set.

  <p class="stbody">Education was on the agenda of the 1951 Annual Meeting. 
  Although the PCC had wished for the school to become 'Aided', instead it was 
  to be a 'Controlled' State school.&nbsp; For the first time in these Minutes,&nbsp; the 
  subject of Parish boundaries was raised.&nbsp; For several years, the civil 
  parishes of Arborfield and Newland had been joined as one, but the old 
  ecclesiastical boundaries still ruled. People living at Arborfield Cross would 
  be married or buried at Bearwood Church unless they were on the electoral roll 
  of Arborfield Church&nbsp; [this boundary revision didn't take place until the late 
  1970's].</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1952</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The PCC was informed at its January 1952 meeting that the 
  Rector had been offered the living of <b>Budbrook</b>, so he was resigning as Rector 
  of Arborfield. Although they had enjoyed close fellowship with their 
  congregation, the <b>Sparshotts</b> found the Rectory too difficult to manage. The 
  Rector singled out for special praise his Verger, <b>Mr Cox</b>, who lived in Church 
  Lane. The School was now State controlled, but the School House and its sparse 
  facilities - it had no bathroom - were still the responsibility of the Church 
  Trustees. It was planned to hand the Trusteeship over to the Diocesan Board of 
  Finance.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The 1952 Annual Meeting had to face the news that 
  <b>Brigadier Chadwick</b> was moving from the parish during the inter-regnum. Mr Foxton (who had recently sorted out the Parish Magazine's finances) took over 
  the role. Also, Mrs Simonds announced her impending departure.&nbsp; A new face on 
  the PCC was <b>Stan Leach</b>. The meeting agreed to hand over the old church 
  records, some dating back to 1700, to the care of the County Record Office.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The Bishop of Reading attended the next PCC meeting in 
  July 1952 along with the temporary incumbent, the <b>Rev. Sellars</b>, who had been 
  energetic during his short stay in the Rectory. The Sunday School had been 
  boosted from 10 to 30 children through the assistance of Mrs Foxton and the 
  Young Wives' Group. The Bishop reported that no-one could be interested to 
  apply for a permanent living because the Rectory was far too large and 
  expensive for any Rector. The next PCC meeting heard that a new Rectory was 
  proposed on the Reading Road near Pudding Lane, and that an applicant, Rev. 
  Bond, might become Rector if a new Rectory were being built.</p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1953</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">Tenants in the Rectory were causing difficulties by the 
  January 1953 meeting. Because the tenants had nowhere to go, three potential 
  incumbents had refused the living because the Rectory was still occupied.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The 1953 Annual Meeting heard that the Bell Captain <b>Mr 
  Day</b> had been called-up for National Service, and <b>Laurie Hall</b> had kindly taken 
  over the small remaining team of six&nbsp; <i>[Laurie remained in post for many 
  decades, and the bell-ringing team was much strengthened during his time]</i>.&nbsp; 
  <b>Major Williamson</b> became chairman of the PCC. </p>
  <p class="stbody">The troubled question of the Rectory occupied the July 
  1953 meeting. Consideration had been given to dividing the Rectory into two 
  reasonably sized houses, one to be let. The Bishop of Reading had not at first 
  approved of this plan, but was now won over along with the Church 
  Commissioners. The scheme was agreed to, but a subsequent meeting was told 
  that the Church Commissioners had not given their consent after all. Opinion 
  was now divided both in the PCC and in the parish at large as to the 
  desirability of splitting the Rectory.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The December meeting was also concerned with the future 
  of the Rectory.&nbsp; <b>A typewritten report on the proposed conversion of the 
  Rectory into two semi-detached houses, with garages, stores, etc., was 
  attached to the Minute Book. In summary,&nbsp; the existing Rectory was an 'L' 
  shape of 4,670 square feet on two floors, and could be split into one of 2,688 
  square feet and one of 1,982 square feet. The separation would consist of bricking up 
  three doors. The larger dwelling would form the Rectory, with the dining room 
  reduced in size to allow for a new entrance lobby. The five bedrooms would be 
  reduced to four, plus a new bathroom and WC.&nbsp; In the smaller dwelling, there 
  would also be four bedrooms plus a bathroom. The garage would be split, with 
  the first-floor storage going to the Rectory.</b></p>
  <p class="stbody">Some loose ends would need to be dealt with. The new 
  tenants must be carefully selected. Also, the Rectory Paddock might 
  be disposed of. It was currently in use by <b>Mr Lee</b> for keeping pigs. The 
  meeting agreed to go ahead with the proposed split, but would record the 
  unanimous opinion that the PCC would have preferred a new Rectory if this were 
  practicable.</p>
  <p class="stbody">A new name appeared in the December meeting. <b>Mrs Canham</b> 
  of Greensward Lane was thanked for playing the Organ during the illness of the 
  Organist.&nbsp; <i>[Allan and Margaret Canham were later to serve the parish over many 
  years both on the PCC and the Parish Council before retiring to Lincolnshire 
  in the late 1980's].</i></p>
  <p class="sthead"><font size="4">1954</font></p>
  <p class="stbody">The organist, <b>Mr Collis</b>, had died before the April 1954 
  meeting, and the PCC mourned their loss. <b>Mr Bunce</b> was found to replace him. 
  It was recorded that the fact that he lived in the Parish in addition to his skills both as 
  Organist and Choirmaster caused the PCC to approve his appointment 
  unanimously.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="stbody">The 1954 Annual Meeting had cause to thank the Revs. 
  <b>Wickstead</b> and <b>Hinton</b> for their services during the year, and also to 
  <b>Mr Foxton</b> 
  in his duties as Sequestrator over the future of the Rectory. <b>Mrs Hall</b> was no 
  longer able to serve on the PCC due to ill-health, and proposing that <b>Miss 
  Hall</b> could take her place&nbsp; <i>[Miss Hall served as a Sunday School Teacher for 
  four decades].</i>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p class="stbody">Work was proceeding well on the Rectory sub-division. No 
  tenant had been found, and it was felt that if the two dwellings could be 
  completely separated, than the new Rector need not have to be consulted over 
  the choice [The Rectory and Rectory Close are still to some extent 'Siamese 
  Twins', since no satisfactory way was ever found to divide the drive and the 
  frontages]. The Meeting also heard that <b>Mr Andrews</b>, member of the PCC and also 
  Headmaster of the 'Newland, Arborfield and Barkham Schools' was due to move 
  away from the parish, which would be a great loss to both organisations.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The Minute Book was on to its last page after the 1954 
  Annual Meeting, and so it came to an end more than fifty years ago, leaving a 
  cliff-hanger in the tradition of that other 'everyday story of country folk'</p>
  <p class="stbody">However, in April 1955, the 1954 Minutes were signed by the new
  <b>Rector C Hamilton Wilson</b>, thus 
  resolving the Inter-Regnum of nearly three years. </p>
