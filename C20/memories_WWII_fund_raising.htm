<p>The parishioners of Arborfield and surrounding villages spent a lot of time 
in fund-raising during the war. </p>

<p>There were very many whist-drives, dances, pony shows, etc., plus 
house-to-house collections, all faithfully recorded in the columns of the 
'Reading Mercury' and less often in the 'Times and Weekly News'.</p>

<p>In November 1939, the 'Mercury' announced a <font size="2"><b>'Poppy Day 
Record' <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">as follows:</span></b> 'The Newland, 
Arborfield, Barkham and Bear Wood branch of the <b>British Legion</b> collected 
a total of £63. 11s. 6d, bringing the overall total collected since 1921 to £463 
12s. 5d.' The year ended with a British Legion whist-drive at the Village Hall.</font></p>

<font size="2">
<p>On August 31st 1940, the 'Mercury' stated: <b>'H. M. S. Garth Comforts Fund – 
Show at Newlands, Arborfield'</b> : 'The horse and dog show held at Newlands, 
Arborfield, on Wednesday in aid of the fund to provide comforts for the ship’s 
company of <b>H.M.S. Garth</b>, was a great success.' [There was a long list of 
winners]. </p>
<p>The following year at the same time, a horse show was organised by <b>Mrs. 
Simonds of Newlands</b> in aid of <b>Prisoner of War funds</b>, at a time when 
the villagers knew that a few of their number had been captured and imprisoned.</p>
<p>On September 5th 1942, it was announced that, as a result of a house-to-house 
collection, organised by <b>Mr. J. H. Simonds</b>, '£7 1s. 8d. has been raised 
for the <b>National Air Raid Distress Fund</b>.' </p>
<p>Later in September, a <b>Fete and Baby Show</b>, held at <b>Newlands</b>, was 
organised by <b>Mrs. Simonds</b> in aid of the funds of the <b>Women’s Section 
of the British Legion</b>, £7 - 8s. being made.</p>
<p>The November 14th issue of the 'Mercury'&nbsp; stated that the village raised 
£2,726 in the ten weeks of the <b>Tanks For Attack </b>campaign.</p>
<p>At the end of 1942, it was reported that a whist drive at the Village Hall, 
organised by <b>Mr. W. J. Verrall</b> and a committee raised £18 – 14s – 10d for 
the <b>Royal Berkshire Hospital Special Appeal</b>., which a few months before, 
needed to raise around £45,000 (every little helped). 'Winners were: Messrs. <b>
F. Parker</b>, <b>Lush</b>, <b>Martin</b>, <b>Saunders</b>, <b>M. Hunt</b>, <b>
C. Hunt</b>, <b>A. Lawrence</b>, Mesdames <b>J. Streak</b>, <b>R. Day</b>, <b>
Ryan</b>, <b>P. Hornby</b>, <b>R. Hall</b>, <b>F. Parker</b>, <b>E. Parker</b>,
<b>Hunt</b>'. By January 2<sup>nd</sup>, the appeal still needed £2,500 to clear 
the £50,000 debt. A full page was devoted to a list of donors from throughout 
Berkshire.</p>
<p>In mid-March 1943, 'the social and dance evening organised by the <b>Women’s 
Section of the Arborfield and Barkham branch of the British Legion</b> realised 
£15. 14s. for the <b>Red Cross Prisoners of War Fund</b>'.</p>
<p>On May 1st, the '<b>Wings For Victory</b>' committee 'announce that the 
target figure will be £1,750. There will be a <b>church parade</b> on May 16<sup>th</sup>; 
other events in the week following include a <b>whist drive</b>, a <b>dance</b>, 
a <b>garden party at</b> <b>"Newlands"</b>, and <b>an entertainment</b>'. 
Meanwhile, mid-way through the same month, 'A <b>pony and dog show</b> organised 
by <b>Mrs. J. H. Simonds</b> and held at <b>Newlands</b> realised over £80 for 
the <b>Berkshire Prisoners of War Fund</b>'. There followed a long list of 
winners.</p>
<p>The edition of August 7th reported two fund-raising efforts. For the <b>
Hospital Contributory Scheme</b>, it said that in the quarter ending June 30<sup>th</sup> 
1943, £43. 14s. 2d. was collected – the highest amount ever recorded in one 
quarter. For <b>Cancer Relief</b>, 'the sum of £17. 7s. 5d. has been sent to the 
Empire Cancer Relief Fund: £16. 7s. 2d. from a <b>house-to-house collection</b> 
and £1. 0s. 3d. as a result of a <b>whist drive</b> organised by <b>Mr. W. J. 
Verrall</b>'.</p>
<p>In October, it was announced that '<b>The Prisoners of War (Red Cross) Fund</b> 
benefited by £16. 16s. as a result of the sale of surplus produce at the recent
<b>Village Produce Association Show</b>'. </p>
<p>The <b>Women's Institute</b> put on an entertainment at the Village Hall, as 
recorded in the 'Mercury' of October 6th 1943: 'The large audience joined in 
community singing, which was led by the <b>local band</b> (<b>Mrs. Cowley</b>,
<b>Mr. B. Kent</b>, <b>Cpl. G. Allen</b>, and <b>"Bernard"</b>), the last two 
having given up an important engagement in order to be present. Two humorous 
sketches were presented, "Red Wax", in which Mesdames <b>Newton</b>, <b>Capper</b>,
<b>Jarvis</b>, <b>Moore</b>, <b>Goddard</b> and <b>Slade</b> appeared, while <b>
Mrs. Edwards</b>, <b>Mrs. Scott</b> and <b>Mrs. B. Kent</b> were "Good 
Neighbours". "The Tramps" (<b>Sidney Cook</b> and <b>Gordon W. Stidder</b>), 
rendered Hill Billy songs. <b>Mrs. Verrall</b>, the producer, was presented with 
a bunch of carnations by <b>Mrs. J. H. Simonds</b>, on behalf of the performers. 
Part of the proceeds will be sent to <b>St. Dunstan’s</b>.' </p>
<p>On May 20th 1944, the 'Mercury' stated that 'The sum of £24 10s 9d was raised 
last week for the <b>Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street</b>, 
through the efforts of <b>Mr. A. J. Bentley</b>, <b>Mr. E. Parker</b>, and a 
committee composed of Mesdames <b>Streak</b>, <b>Inglis</b>, <b>Kent</b> and <b>
Oates</b>. A <b>whist drive</b> realised £3, a <b>dance</b> £8, <b>competitions</b> 
£10 6s 6d, and <b>donations</b> £3 0s 6d. Prizes were presented for the 
competitions by <b>Mrs. E. Parker</b>, <b>Mrs. Orchard</b> and <b>Miss J. 
Wakeley</b>.' </p>
<p>Four weeks later, 'In response to an appeal from <b>Queen Charlotte Maternity 
Hospital</b>, a successful <b>whist drive</b> was organised by <b>Mrs. Inglis</b> 
and <b>Mrs. Streak</b>, on behalf of the <b>British Legion Women’s Section</b>. 
As a result, and a most generous gift by <b>Mrs. E. Parker</b>, dance organiser, 
a cheque for £18 has been sent. Thanks are extended to all who helped and gave 
prizes.'</p>
<p>These sums paled into insignificance when the July 8th edition announced: 
'The sum of £6,979 was raised in the village during <b>Salute the Soldier Week</b>, 
handsomely exceeding the target.' The newspapers had been carrying reports and 
photos of ‘Salute the Soldier Weeks’ in towns and villages since before D-Day, 
squeezing out other items.</p>
<p>In its monthly news item, the Arborfield branch of the Women's Institute 
branch reported: '<b>A talk on Occupational Handicrafts for Invalid Prisoners of 
War</b> was given by Mrs. Giles, of Finchampstead, at the July meeting at 
Arborfield. She explained how this work helps the wounded, many of whom are 
bed-ridden, paralysed or have lost limbs, and she gave a practical demonstration 
of the kind of work produced by our prisoners from the materials sent out to 
them by the Red Cross. The members went home determined to turn out their 
rag-bags and lumber rooms for contributions in kind to help our prisoners.' The 
following month's W.I. report stated: 'To raise funds for <b>Friendless Sailors’ 
Christmas parcels</b>, a comprehensive house-to-house collection is being 
organised'.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the 'Mercury' carried this news item on October 28th: '<b>Church 
Appeal</b> – Under the joint signatures of <b>Canon J. A. Anderson</b> 
(Chairman), <b>Mr. J. H. Simonds</b>, <b>Mrs. E. M. Prescott</b> (treasurer) and
<b>Major H. S. Morris</b>, the <b>Parochial Church Council </b>has launched an 
appeal for contributions towards the cost of renovating the church organ, which 
is in danger of imminent collapse. The total cost will be at least £1,000, and 
it is hoped to raise at least £30 by November 1<sup>st</sup>, each household 
being invited to contribute 2s. 6d. It is understood that this can be taken as 
part of the £50 asked for by the end of the year by the Bishop of Oxford in his 
recent Diocesan Appeal.'</p>
<p>In early 1945, there was a whole string of fund-raising events:</p>
<p>February 10th: <b>'Welcome Home Fund</b>: A concert was presented by the 
Barkham Youth Club at Arborfield Village Hall on Thursday last, and realised £6 
– 10s. for "Tich" Barker’s Welcome Home Fund.'</p>
<p>February 17th: <b>'Welcome Home Fund</b>: A dance at the Village Hall on 
Saturday realised £4. 2s. 9d. for "Tich" Barker’s Welcome Home Fund.'</p>
<p>February 24th: <b>'Welcome Home Fund</b>: £14. 14s. 6d. was raised for "Tich" 
Barker’s Welcome Home Fund at a dance held at the Village Hall on Saturday.'</p>
<p>March 3rd: '<b>Welcome Home Fund</b>. The "Tich" Barker appeal on behalf of 
the Welcome Home Fund organised by <b>Mrs. Inglis</b> and the <b>entertainments 
committee of the British Legion, Women’s Section</b>, has raised to date £25. 
11s. 4d.</p>
<p>March 10th: <b>'Welcome Home Fund</b>: £4. 15s. was realised for "Tich" 
Barker’s appeal for the Welcome Home Fund at a dance at the Village Hall on 
Saturday.'</p>
<p>It wasn't all for the 'Welcome Home Fund'. The same issue stated: 'At a <b>
whist drive</b> held at the Village Hall, £24. 6s. 6d. was raised for the funds 
of <b>St. Dunstan’s</b>. On Tuesday next and succeeding Tuesdays, <b>whist 
drives</b> in aid of the <b>Red Cross </b>will be held at the Village Hall.' 
Also, the Women's Institute announced that it 'is co-operating in the <b>
Household Gift Scheme </b>organised by the <b>W.V.S.</b>, for <b>bomb-damaged 
Lewisham</b>.' </p>
<p>There were several other dances held in aid of the <b>'Welcome Home Fund'</b>, 
but as yet we haven't found out what happened to the Fund.....</p>
<p>On October 27th, the Mercury reported: '<b>Savings Week</b>: Arborfield 
exceeded their target of £1,500 easily with a total of £1,903. 15s. 6d. Whist 
drives and dances held during the week contributed £7. 2s.'</p>
