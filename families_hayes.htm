<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">spent nearly 60 years in Arborfield, 40 of them 
as Rector, from September 1839 to 1879.&nbsp; </span></font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">According to <b>Debrett's Baronetage</b>, the
<b>Hayes family</b> had been settled in Ireland from the period of the civil 
wars, in the time of Charles I. <b>Edmund Hayes</b> went over with Cromwell's 
party, and attained to the rank of colonel in his army. His son <b>Daniel Hayes</b>, 
of Mayvore, was a captain in the army at the battle of the Boyne. Daniel’s 
grandson <b>Sir John Macnamara, M.D</b>., was physician to His Majesty's forces 
serving in North America during the whole of the War of Independence, and was 
created a baronet. In 1787, he married <b>Ann</b>, daughter of <b>Henry White</b>, 
of the Council of New York. Their eldest son <b>Thomas Pelham Hayes</b>, born in 
1794, succeeded to the title in 1809; he became a Writer in the Bengal 
Establishment. The second son was <b>John Warren Hayes</b>, born in London in 
1799. </font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">In 1832 <b>John Warren Hayes</b> purchased the 
living in Arborfield, but had to wait until the death of the incumbent <b>Henry 
Hodgkinson</b> before he could come to the Jacobean Arborfield Rectory in 1839; 
in the meantime, he was a Vicar near Bantry in south-west Ireland. Arborfield's 
Rectory was delightful but decrepit, and was replaced by the large Victorian 
building soon after.</p></font> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">In the 1841 Census, we find <b>Rev. John Warren 
Hayes</b> at the Rectory, still single, and his brother-in-law the <b>Rev. 
Thomas Robertson</b> with his wife <b>Anna</b> and three servants. John married
<b>Ellen Beauchamp</b> of the Priory, Beech Hill, in 1844. They had a daughter
<b>Ellen Anne Hayes</b>, born in 1846, and a son <b>John Beauchamp Hayes</b> in 
1849. Sadly, <b>Ellen Hayes</b> died in August aged only 32, and was buried in 
the old churchyard on August 23<sup>rd</sup> 1849, just a week before her son 
was baptised.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">By 1851, <b>Rev. John Warren Hayes</b> was 
bringing up his son and daughter with the aid of seven servants. At the Census, 
his brother <b>Sir Thomas Pelham Hayes, Bart.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, 
was visiting. Thomas died later in 1851, and John inherited the&nbsp; title.</span></b> 
Not only was the Rectory rebuilt, but in 1863 the old Church building was 
replaced by the Hargreaves family, the new owners of Arborfield Hall. <b>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Mrs_Hargreaves.htm">Sarah Hargreaves</a></b> was from the <b>
Washington Jackson</b> family, so both John Hayes and Sarah Hargreaves had 
American connections.</font></p>

<p><i>On January 25th 1896, the 'Reading Mercury' reported:</i></p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>DEATH OF SIR JOHN W. HAYES, OF ARBORFIELD</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>Early on Thursday morning the venerable <b>Rev. Sir John Warren Hayes</b>, 
baronet, died at Newlands, near Arborfield, the residence of his son-in-law, <b>
Mr. John Simonds</b>, where he had spent, in quiet retirement, the closing years 
of his long life. Sir John Hayes was in his 97<sup>th</sup> year, and though 
lately he had been very ailing and weak, he was in full possession of his 
faculties until the last. </p>
<p>He was born in 1799, and educated at Harrow and Wadham College, Oxford, and 
took his M.A. degree in 1824. After being ordained he was curate of Great 
Malvern, until appointed to the living of Shandrum, in Ireland, which he 
exchanged in 1839 for that of Arborfield, near Reading, of which parish he was 
rector for over 40 years, namely until 1880, when he resigned. </p>
<p>At the time of his death he was the oldest clergyman of the Church of 
England, also the oldest baronet, and the oldest Freemason in England, probably 
a unique coincidence. </p>
<p>In 1844 he married the second daughter of <b>Mr. George Beauchamp</b>, of The 
Priory, Berks, but was left a widower five years later. In 1851 he succeeded his 
brother in the baronetcy, which now becomes extinct, his only son having died 
some years since. His daughter, <b>Mrs. John Simonds</b>, and her husband have 
devoted great care and attention to him, in their pleasant home at Newlands, and 
have contributed much to render his declining years peaceful and happy. They 
were both with him, together with other members of the family, when he breathed 
his last. Throughout East Berks, Sir John Hayes was widely known and greatly 
esteemed. </p>
<p>The funeral will take place in Arborfield. </p>
<p>Sir John was initiated a Freemason in 1819, on the creation of the Apollo 
Lodge, Oxford. He took a leading part in promoting the interests of the Order in 
the province of Berks and Bucks, as Deputy Provincial Grand Master, during the 
rule of the late <b>Sir Daniel Gooch</b>, after whose decease the two counties 
were separated for Masonic purposes, and constituted district Provinces. </p>
<p>Sir John was the oldest living member of the Lodge of Union at Reading, 
having joined the Lodge on July 6, 1840, from the Foundation Lodge. He was also 
a Past Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge of England, and his kind and genial 
presence was always most welcome at Masonic gatherings, whether in the 
metropolis or in the Provinces.</p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: 400">One week later, another 
article appeared in the 'Mercury': </span></b></p>
</font><font size="3">
<p align="center"><b>FUNERAL OF SIR JOHN HAYES AT ARBORFIELD</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>The funeral of the Rev. Sir John Warren Hayes, Bart., whose decease was 
announced in last week’s Mercury, took place at Arborfield on Monday afternoon, 
in dull weather. The obsequies were plain and simple in character. There 
were no floral decorations in Arborfield Church, where the service was held, and 
where the deceased and venerable gentleman had once ministered for forty years. In 
the village there was every manifestation of respect, the blinds being drawn.
</p>
<p>The cortège left "Newlands" about two o’clock, and at the church the coffin, 
covered with wreaths and crosses, was met at the doors by the <b>Rev. J. Jones</b> 
(Rector), and <b>A. L. White</b>, of Mortimer, a cousin of the deceased. </p>
<p><b>Mr. H. Webster</b>, the organist, rendered Mendelssohn’s beautiful piece 
"The Lord is mindful of His own". The sacred building was filled with people. 
The Rev. A. L. White read the opening sentences of the service, and the 
congregation responded alternately in the reading of Psalm xx. The usual  
lesson, from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Corinthians was read by the Rector, and the 
hymn "The saints of God", led by the choir, was feelingly sung. After other 
prayers, the hymn "Peace, perfect peace", was softly rendered, and as the 
congregation were leaving Mr. Webster played "O rest in the Lord". </p>
<p>Then the graveside portion of the service was conducted, in the presence of a 
large gathering. After the final prayer the mourners threw in bunches of 
violets, and the Freemasons who were present dropped on the coffin sprays of 
acacia which they had worn. Sir John was at the time of his death the oldest 
member of Lodge of Union 414, as well as the oldest Freemason in England.</p>
<p>The mourners were:- <b>Mr. and Mrs. Simonds</b>, the <b>Misses Simonds</b>,
<b>Mr. J. H. Simonds</b>, <b>Master M. K. Simonds</b>, <b>Mrs. Hayes</b>, <b>Sir 
Frederick Fits Wygram</b>, <b>Mr. and Mrs. William Simonds</b>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Carriages were sent by <b>Mr. Simonds</b>, <b>Mrs. Simonds</b> (Winnersh), 
<b>Mrs. Martin Atkins</b>, <b>Mr. W. Simonds</b>, <b>Mr. A. F. Walter</b>, <b>Mrs. T. 
Hargreaves</b>, <b>Mr. Sanderson</b>, the <b>Rev. J. Jones</b>, <b>Mrs. Gray</b> 
(Farley Hill).</p>
<p>[There followed a long list of clergy representatives, parishioners and 
Freemasons, plus floral tributes].</p>
<p>The coffin, which was of plain oak with elegant brass fittings, bore a 
massive plate on which was inscribed:- <i><b>"The Rev. Sir John Warren Hayes, 
Bt., born 13 Aug 1799, died 23 Jany. 1896"</b></i>.</p>
<p>The entire management was carried out by <b>
<a href="C20/families_William_Vincent.htm">Mr. W. Vincent</a></b>, of 
Arborfield.</p>
