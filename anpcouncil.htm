<p class="stbody"><span lang="en-gb">After 1948, Arborfield and Newland became a 
single Parish Council, though the two had worked closely together during 
wartime.</span></p>
<p class="stbody"><span lang="en-gb">The first items dealt with by the new 
Council were typical rural issues: footpaths, bus stops, preservation of trees, 
village green, etc. - a true rural idyll. In recent times, the Council’s 
business has been dominated by the A327 and traffic, Waste Transfer Stations, 
housing development, Structure Plans, Transport Plans, Loddon Area Plans, 
Housing Plans.......<br>
<br>
The building of the M4 and the rush of developers and planners, leading to the 
rape of the Berkshire countryside, has altered the nature of the area beyond 
recognition. The car and lorry dominate, with little thought given to 
infrastructure. </span></p>

<p align="justify" class="stbody">This article uses extracts from Minutes of the 
Annual Meetings, which effectively 'took the pulse' of the parish during this 
period of change up to the early 1980's, when there was a lull in large 
development for at least 15 years.</p>

<p align="justify" class="stbody">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify" class="stbody">The <b>1948 joint meeting</b> at the Village 
Hall was well-attended with 
60 present, because the new amalgamated Council was due to be elected. Ten 
parishioners were proposed for the seven places, and none withdrew their 
nominations, so a poll was held on 5th April, electing: <br><br><b>Albert Jarvis</b>, <br><b>
Brigadier Edward William Chadwick</b>, <br><b>Herbert George Lee</b>, <br><b>Rev. Claude 
Anthony Topp Sparshott</b>, <br><b>Jessie Capper</b> (who also served as District Councillor), <br>
<b>Peter Oades Wakeford</b> and <br><b>Samuel Guy 
Bentley</b>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">By <b>1949</b>, attendance at the Annual 
Meeting declined to 18. 
Concern was still expressed for improvements to roads and to provide footpaths 
for the safety of children.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Electricity had finally been laid on by <b>1950</b>, 
but only to certain parts an<b><a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Bull_1.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Bull and the crossroads, from a 1950's postcard" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Nicky_Ford/TN_Bull_1A.jpg" width="257" height="152"></a></b>d premises. Increased traffic occupied many minds: 
<b>the filled-in Pond was proposed to be a car-par</b>k, presumably for the "Bull" 
Public House; <br>
Parishioners were urged to support a <b>petition for provision of 
footpaths on the A327 road</b>; <br>the southbound <b>bus stops</b> at the <b>Cross</b> and at the 
<b>"Bramshill Hunt"</b> were each to be moved 100 yards further south, to give motorists 
better visibility to pass if two buses met in opposite directions; <br>
and Brigadier 
Chadwick asked if the buses normally carrying school children could be diverted 
along Langley Common Road and past the school. <br>The question of a <b>Playing Field</b>, 
dormant since before the War, was again raised. <br>A <b>Civil Defence Scheme</b> was to be 
started. <br>Closer to home, Sewage Disposal Tanks were to be provided by the R.D.C., 
and <b>an appeal was made for weekly refuse collection, rather than fortnightly.</b></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The Councillors were busy in the following year, 
attending 10 Council meetings instead of the usual 4.  </p>
<p align="left" class="stbody">A Public Meeting was 
called in February <b>1951</b> to consider the findings of the <b>Survey of Rights of Way</b>, 
and to record objections. The annual meeting in March was particularly 
well-attended. Buses for schoolchildren would not be diverted, but Police would 
supervise crossing the road near the bus stops. No fewer than nine sites had 
been viewed f<a href="Memories_Herbert_Lee.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Herbert Lee of Newland Farm, who loaned space for a sports field" vspace    =5 align=left src="images/Thumb/Herbert_Lee.jpg" width=154 height=203 ></a>or a Playing Field. <br>In the meantime, <b>Mr Lee</b> was prepared to allow 
the continued use of the field already loaned by him for football, to be also 
used for cricket and organised games, subject to review each year. <br>The chairman,
<b>Rev. Sparshott</b>, pointed out that, due to <b>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Mr Lee</span></b>'s kindness, the village had 
always had most of these facilities, at which the audience cheered Mr Lee. <br>The 
<b>British Legion</b> might, as soon as they developed their land, provide Tennis and 
Bowls facilities. <br>As far as a children's playground was concerned, there might 
be a satisfactory arrangement with the W.R.D.C. <b>"regarding the open space in the 
centre of Anderson Avenue"</b>. Among other items, possible extensions to the 
chronically-overcrowded Village Hall were discussed; these would cost about £900.</p>
<font size="4"><b>
<p>Domestic crises</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"><b>Mr A Jarvis</b> took over the chairmanship in
<b>1952</b> 
when <b>Rev. Sparshott</b> moved from the 
<a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Cross_2.jpg">

<p align="left" class="stbody">He reported progress on getting 
<b>footpaths on parts of the A327</b> to what was described as an "interesting meeting" 
of 28 people. <br><br>There were several questions about the lack of electricity to <b>nos. 
15 to 32 Council Houses</b>, despite a transformer near-by (though it later transpired 
that this belonged to the <b>War Dept.</b>), <br>and the <b>overflowing cess-pools</b> at these 
houses, which the W.R.D.C. only emptied once every two months, despite filling-up within 3 weeks. The people were advised to complain "en bloc" to the W.R.D.C.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">At a Parish Council election on 9th May <b>1952</b>, 
seven of the eleven candidates were successful:</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"><b>Mrs Capper</b>, <b><br>Mr H G Lee</b>, <br><b>Mr A 
Jarvis</b>, <br><b>Mr S G Bentley</b>, <br><b>Mr Johns</b>, <br><b>Mr Foxton</b>, <br><b>Mr T J 
Chitty</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">A special meeting was called in November 1952 
to consider a house-to-house collection for the <b>King George VI Memorial Fund</b>, 
and for plans to celebrate the forthcoming <b>Coronation</b>. One suggestion was to put 
a rented television in the Village Hall for the villagers to view the ceremony.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The <b>1953</b> meeting was told that the <b>Parish 
Cottages</b> were becoming a liability <a href="parishcottages.htm">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Parish Cottages by the Bull in Swallowfield Road, at a time when the Pond still contained water" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Village_Pondlet.jpg" width=254 height=154 ></a>because fixed rents could not meet the costs 
of maintenance, and that when one of the pair in <b>Swallowfield Road</b> became 
vacant, they would be disposed of.  </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The new Council Houses [<b>at Anderson/Emblen 
Crescents</b>] would not have garages on the ground of cost. Existing W.R.D.C. 
tenants could now purchase their houses if they so desired. The final stage of 
the survey of footpaths, bridleways and <a href="properties_guardroom.htm">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Guardroom and Camp Post Office, off Eversley Road (now Bramshill Close)" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Thumb/Guardrooms2.jpg" width="150" height="96"></a>cart tracks was reached, and a map was 
being displayed for four months at the Camp Post Office where <b>Mr S C Bentley</b> was 
sub-postmaster. [As a result, there was a hearing into a disputed footpath on 
Arborfield Hall Farm, at which Arthur Bentley, the Parish Clerk, put the case in 
favour - click <b><a href="properties_hall_footpath.htm">here</a></b> to read 
the details of the dispute]  </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Regarding bus stops, the southbound one near the Cross needed to 
be moved because 70 school children would all be waiting on a narrow section of 
path, preventing others from passing. Among other items, complaints were made 
about the <b>"unpleasant odour emitting when the cesspool was emptied each week 
from the Bramshill Hunt into Wokingham Lane"</b>.</p>
<b><font size="4">
<p>Electricity for all?</p>
</font></b>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">In <b>1954</b>, people continued to complain about 
the lack of electricity for all and the lack of sewage facilities except for the 
new Council Houses. <b>Victor Foxton</b> was the new chairman; new business included a 
demand for a <b>footpath along School Road</b>, which was now a busy one; and for a 
telephone kiosk in Lower Arborfield [this was never provided].</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The District Councillor reported each year on 
the progress made to reduce the housing list. By 1954, W.R.D.C. had built 715 
Council Houses since the War, but in 1955 she had to report that the Council had only 
been allowed to build 50 that year.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"><b>Council Houses 15 to 32</b> [those near the 
'Bramshill Hunt'] were finally connected 
to Main Sewage and electricity by the <b>1955</b> meeting. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">When <b>Norman Hart</b> took over as chairman in
<b>1956</b>, he was able to report that some of the Parish Cottages were now improved: 
electricity was installed in those in Greensward Lane. However, those in Swallowfield Road were now condemned, and the tenants were now on the housing 
list. <b>Walden Avenue</b> was mentioned for the first time: because it was a private 
road, nothing could be done about the dangerous exit onto the main road [Walden 
Avenue was not yet surfaced]. The <b>War Department</b> had withdrawn their demands for 
extra ground for training purposes; these had included <b>Kidgem's Copse</b> and the
<b>Coombes</b>. However, the <b>Ducks Nest Farm</b> area was to be used for minor tactical 
training.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">By <b>1957</b> the Council House waiting list 
had reduced to 550, 32 of them from Arborfield. 90 families had been housed in
<b>1956/7</b>, and 113 houses were under construction in Woodley. A further 300 
were planned throughout the Rural District, and it was anticipated that the 
waiting list would dwindle to nothing within another year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">There were no members of the public at the 
<b>1957</b> meeting, while only one attended in <b>1958</b>, where it was reported that the 
<b>Parish Cottages in Swallowfield Road</b> were about to be demolished, now that <b>Mrs 
Hawkins</b> had been re-housed "in the Newlands Estate".</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">In <b>1959</b>, the state of the <b>old churchyard</b> was 
again discussed. It could not be cleared until existing buildings which were 
considered unsafe were demolished. Four more houses in the village had been 
condemned, and the tenants needed to be re-housed. <b>Mr Beton</b> asked if footpath 
No. 16 be closed because it ran to <b>School Road</b> through the planned estate 
adjoining the <b>British Legion</b>; a new road [<b>Link Way</b>] linking with the 
<b>Newlands 
Estate</b> would render it unnecessary.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Despite the fond hopes of W.R.D.C. a couple of 
years earlier, the Council House waiting list had not shrunk 
by <b>1959</b> after all; at that time, there were just over 600 on the list, 31 of them from 
Arborfield.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">School Road was finally provided with a 
footpath by <b>1960</b>. The new chairman, <b>Guy Bentley</b>, listed the village 
organisations, including the W.I., the Young Wives' Group, the 60-strong 
Gardening Association and a popular weekly Whist Drive organised by Miss 
Smith for funds for a summer outing for the Old Age Pensioners. However, the <b>
Royal Observer Corps</b> only had 7 members, and was in danger of disbanding. 
Mr. Bentley said that "they would face an impossible task should hostilities 
ever break out again. One does not realise that these men train not only for 
aircraft recognition, but also for radioactive fallout which would endanger the 
lives of all should ever a nuclear [strike] occur". </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The District Councillor reported that several 
local people had been housed, some locally and some in Woodley. "<b>The R.D.C. 
recognise that the housing problem was acute in Arborfield, but there is no land 
available for building</b>; also, that <b>there are a number of under-populated houses 
in the village</b>". [This problem would persist for another decade until new 
bungalows were built in three new locations - Whitewell Close, Harts Close and 
the civilian part of Valon Road]. </p>
<b><font size="4">
<p>A Dormitory Village? </p>
</font></b>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Mr Bentley said the following year that, if 
ever the progress of this parish were written, <b>1960 to 1961 would be recorded as 
the year in which the character of Arborfield and Newland experienced the 
greater alteration</b>. The two new housing estates [Link Way and Melrose 
Gardens] were bringing a different 
atmosphere to the village. Where in years gone by the main livelihood was 
derived from agriculture, now the parishioners consist of civil servants, 
engineers, aircraft workers and many others. The demolition of the Post Office 
Cottages would, no doubt, result in a useful addition of new houses to the 
village, and it was hoped that the new buildings would be erected to fit in with 
the character of the Village Street and surrounding buildings. The vacant site 
opposite the Bull was to be purchased by the County Council for road 
improvements.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The <b>1962</b> meeting was told that the Greensward 
Lane cottages were now condemned; the tenants would be re-housed and the land 
sold. The Old Pond site was still an eyesore, being cut up by parking heavy 
vehicles; however, the War Memorial and surrounds were being very well-kept by
<b>Mr Clace</b><b>y</b>. T<a href="images/M_Shearn/Melrose_Gdns_1.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The second phase of Melrose Gardens, on land behind the village shop" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/M_Shearn/Melrose_Gdns_1_TN.jpg" width="187" height="125"></a>he old church had been made safe by removing the roof. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Land behind 
the Village Stores had been sold for development [this land became the extension 
of <b>Melrose Gardens</b> beyond the footpath to Arborfield Court]. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Parts of the main street were still not 
connected to main drainage.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Eight members of the public were present in 
<b>1963</b> to hear that the <b>Playing Fields Association</b> had levelled and seeded the 
site at the British Legion, and it was now available for use by football teams. 
Any parishioners interested in forming a <b>bowls or tennis club</b> were to contact 
the Secretary of the PFA.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"><b>Ernest Mann</b> took the chair in <b>1964</b>, when 
<b>Link 
Way</b> was first mentioned by name: its residents complained of the terrific speed 
used by cars and other traffic along it, because there was no speed limit. The 
green in <b>Anderson Crescent</b> was being chewed up by cars being parked on it, there 
being no garages for them. Worse, the footpath path from Eversley Road to 
Anderson Crescent was dangerous because of cyclists, and it <b>'was often being 
used immorally also as a urinal'</b>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The 
<a href="images/M_Shearn/Melrose_Gdns_2.jpg">

of contention in <b>1965</b>, the Council winning a battle to reduce the density from 
16 to 12 houses per acre. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">At this stage, <b>Melrose Gardens opened onto Swallowfield Road</b>, but it would be 
<a href="images/M_Shearn/Whitewell_Close_1973_1.jpg">

linked to Melrose Gardens. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">More development was planned for 12 old peoples' 
flats on <b>land next to Magnolia Cottage</b>, plus 18 flats on the same site 
[this became <b>Whitewell Close</b>].</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Sadly, Ernest Mann had to report that three 
former Councillors had died: <b>Miss Jervoise </b>of Targett's, <b>Mr Norman 
Hart</b> formerly of Emblen Crescent, and <b>Mr Guthrie Allsebrook</b> formerly 
of Arborfield Hall, who'd moved a few years before to Shinfield.</p>
<b><font size="4">
<p>"Your Village"</p>
</font></b>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">A Village Book was planned in <b>1966</b> to help 
make newcomers welcome. <b>Main drainage and sewage pipes</b> in the centre of the 
village were about to be commissioned. The Council were concerned about the 
dangerous road junction at the Cross, suggesting a roundabout and also the re-siting 
of the Bull! At the other end of the village, there were dangerous bends near 
the Bramshill Hunt, and there had been several accidents at the Langley Common 
Road junction, with cars ending up in the ditch. <b>Street lighting</b> was a contentious issue, 81 in favour but 73 
against. A compromise was that lights would be erected on the new estates, but 
that the main road and Church Lane would not be lit. Plans were in hand to buy 
children's play equipment for the British Legion site. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">11 parishioners at the <b>1967</b> meeting heard 
about plans to improve grass areas around the Cross now that the estate was 
complete. The developers [Weaver] were to be pressed to ensure that trees were 
planted as promised. Main drainage might at last come to Walden Avenue, Church 
Lane and Greensward Lane.  </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">Electricity supply was a problem: <b>"Arborfield is 
subjected to a large number of electric cuts which causes a great deal of 
hardship"</b>. A footpath was considered alongside <b>Hillcrest</b>, when funds allowed. 
The vacant land next to the Post Office was overgrown and an eyesore, 
accumulating rubbish; likewise the land between Hillcrest and Melrose Gardens 
[now Harts Close].</p>

<br>Plans had been approved for a new Junior School in the village to take 
increasing numbers of children, <br>and to allow for <b>310 new married quarters</b> at the 
Garrison [Faraday, Fleming and Kelvin Closes, plus infill on the existing 
estates]. <br>A new <b>by-pass</b> around the Garrison was due to 
start construction. <br>The Playing Field Association reported that a fence would be 
erected around the <b>Children's Play Area</b>, at the British Legion site, and that connections to Main Drainage 
would allow toilets to be provided. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The land at Greensward Lane where the former 
Parish Cottages stood would be sold with planning permission for two new houses. 
<b>Mr Harlow</b> asked if Walden Avenue was to be made up when Main Drainage was 
complete, while <b>Mrs Prentice</b> had heard that it was 22nd on the list for the 
County. However, the meeting as a whole considered that the Arborfield Cross 
junction was the main priority. A footpath may be provided adjacent to Cross 
Lanes Farm. The possible reason for the crowded meeting was the discussion of 
speed limits, led by Messrs. <b>Adams</b>, <b>Anderson</b>, <b>Arkell</b>, <b>Attwood</b>, Mann, 
<b>Mason</b>, 
<b>Capt. Meaby</b> and <b>Mrs Berry</b>.</p>

first time prior to the meeting. In it, <b>Ernest Mann</b> mentioned the Village 
Booklet, and also the closer links with the Army Garrison, in particular <b>"that a 
new Army Sports Centre was being planned for the Garrison and that the excellent 
facilities which will be provided will also be available to villagers"</b>. The 
village centre was much tidier, with trees and shrubs planted by Mrs Boot and 
her helpers on the old Village Pond site. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The new by-pass was under construction in 
<b>1970</b>, when parishioners learned with alarm that the Eversley Road would be cut 
off through the camp in conjunction with the new Army housing developments. 
Plans were well advanced to <b>extend the Village Hall</b>, which had been talked about 
for years. Other plans to provide more shops in the village were stagnating. The 
school head, <b>Cyril Piggott</b> (who had been a Parish Councillor and active in many 
organisations) had moved from the village, and was replaced by <b>Leslie Vokes</b>. </p>

<b>Allan Canham</b>'s turn in the chair. He 
said that 1971 would go down as <b>"the year in which Walden Avenue was made up"</b>! 
 
</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The new <b>Infants' School</b> was nearing completion.  </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The British Legion had given the 
Playing Fields Association notice to quit the site as the lease was running out. 
The Council were beginning to look elsewhere for a site, perhaps further behind 
the British Legion. The meeting, provoked "lively discussion", including very 
popular proposals to acquire (rather than lease) a 10 acre site. The scope of 
the Hurst Fuel Allotment which was administered by the Council was broadened. A 
request was made for <b>a footpath from the Cross along Sindlesham Road to its 
junction with Church Lane</b>. Melrose Gardens residents complained of low water 
pressure.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The <b>1972</b> meeting generated a huge crowd of 
about 100 parishioners plus the entire Council. The <b>recreation ground</b> was likely 
to be off Swallowfield Road, but the land owner [Herbert Lee of Newland Farm] did not wish to sell; a 
compulsory purchase order would be required. The meeting was asked to approve a 
£12,000 loan for the development (49 for, 23 against).</p>

<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">By <b>1973</b>, the Hillcrest development [<b>Harts 
Close</b>] was completed, and a landscaping scheme was proposed to alleviate the 
harshness of the elevations, which were more prominent than expected. 
Landscaping of the Garrison by-pass included <b>29 trees planted by parishioners.</b> 
The Fuel Allotment generated very little income: £9 was enough to cover only 5 
lots of 2 cwt in December 1972. The cost of the Recreation Ground had risen to 
£17,000. The cul-de-sac formed by the Garrison by-pass was still known as Eversley Road, which caused confusion. Residents did not want the name to be "Eversley 
Close". <a href="images/Village_queen1.jpg">

<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">69 parishioners attended the <b>1974</b> meeting, 
chaired by <b>Noel Sudbury</b>. They heard that the Recreation Ground site had 
been acquired in September 1973 and was being seeded, but would not be ready 
until 1975. Speed limits and sight-lines continued to cause complaint, and a 
traffic warden had been allocated to the village. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"><b>Mini-roundabouts</b> had been proposed by 
the Parish Council (but rejected by the County) for the five-way junction at the 
Cross, and the Council were maintaining a record of all traffic accidents to be 
used as evidence of need. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The <b>1975</b> meeting was reminded that Arborfield 
had won the <b>"Best-Kept Village"</b> competition at the first attempt. The recreation 
ground was to be opened on 10th May with a celebration, and volunteers had 
planted donated trees. A pavilion was to be built out of the rate levy. The 
recreation ground would be called <b>"Arborfield Park</b>" (11 votes) in preference to 
<b>"Causeway Park"</b> (7 votes) , <b>"The Arbor"</b> (5 votes) or four other suggestions (12 
votes combined). There was <b>a planning appeal against refusal to allow 
development of 28 flats at the site of Newland House</b>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The site of Newland House continued to 
generate heat at the <b>1976</b> meeting, as well as from the burning of tyres and 
cables which was a continuing nuisance. Planning permission had been granted for 
building 19 flats, though the Parish Council objected to the design. <b>Fred Fox
</b>announced that, arising out of the 1975 Park celebrations, the Arborfield 
Entertainments Committee had been formed, initially providing a regular disco.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"><b>The Pavilion</b> was complete and in use by
<b>1977</b>. 
Edition 4 of "Your Village" had been published and distributed. There was a 
spate of vandalism, with new trees being broken. </p>

</font></b>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">'Travellers' were a problem in <b>1978</b>, having 
occupied verges off Langley Common Road. Among other topics mentioned, <b>Peter Teague</b> of the Park Management 
sub-committee reported that the football pitches were well-used and that the car 
park was now surfaced with tarmac.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">34 parishioners attended in <b>1979</b>. The chairman 
reported that Anderson and Emblen Crescents now had street-lights, and that 
Berks County Council planned to illuminate the A327 from Shinfield to Langley 
Common Road. A drainage scheme had been completed at the Park. <b>Fuel allotments</b> 
were down to 2 lots of coal that year. <b>Andrew Harbinson</b> reported that the 
<b>Arborfield Village Association</b> had been formed to replace the Entertainments 
Committee, aiming eventually to provide a social centre large enough to cater 
for the needs of the village.</p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody"></p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">There was a proposal in <b>1980</b> to amalgamate 
Arborfield and Newland with <b>Barkham Parish Council</b> in 1983 together with 
<b>boundary changes</b> at <b>Bearwood</b>, <b>Nash Grove Lane and Doles Lane</b>. <b>Pound Copse</b> was 
finally to be handed over, in exchange for the removal of a stub footpath. </p>

<b>1981</b>. The <b>Village Association</b> had been disbanded, leaving £397 for the 
future hall project. The car park at the recreation ground was to be doubled in 
size to cater for visiting football teams. </p>
<p align="justify" class="stbody">The bus service from Reading via Arborfield 
had been axed, but the council won a reprieve for a much reduced service to be 
provided between Arborfield and Wokingham. The Schools Association had provided 
a cover for the swimming pool.</p>
