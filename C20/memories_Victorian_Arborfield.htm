The following article appeared in the <b>'Reading Standard' of 17th August 1945</b>. 
The contributor was anonymous, but we suspect that it may have been <b>Beatrice 
Simonds</b>, who was a keen amateur local historian who was involved in the <b>
<a href="memories_LHRS.htm">Local History Recording Scheme</a></b>.<p>In 
addition, Beatrice's late father <b>John Simonds</b> had been an Overseer of the 
Poor for many years, so Beatrice already had knowledge of the system.</p>

</b>
<p>Before the coming of modern communications and consequent easy access to the 
towns, the inhabitants of most villages found employment on neighbouring farms 
or in the houses of the gentry. Arborfield, however, boasted several small 
industries which allowed rather more choice of occupation. </p>
<p>Thus successive owners of <b><a href="../properties_hall.htm">Arborfield Hall</a></b> 
utilized the <b>water power</b> of the nearby <b>River Loddon</b>, at different times, 
to work a <b><a href="../properties_mill.htm">paper mill</a></b>, to <b>grind 
corn</b>, and to <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">run a flourishing</span>
<a href="memories_LHRS_6.htm">laundry</a></b>. Nearer at hand in the village 
itself was a <b>wheelwrights’ sho</b><b>p</b>, and not very far away the <b>old 
brick kiln</b>, commemorated today by the <b>
<a href="../properties_Brickworks.htm">Brick Kiln Cottages</a></b> which stand 
by the site. By 1861, when the paper mill was accidentally <b>
<a href="../properties_mill_fire_1861_Mercury.htm">burnt down</a></b>, the 
population had risen from 171 in 1801 to 316, a figure not exceeded again until 
after the first great war.</p>
<b>
<p align="center">CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES</p>
</b>
<p>Much of the life of the villagers, particularly when they fell out of work, 
can be gleaned from the pages of the <b>parish overseer’s register</b>. Long 
before the days of social insurance he is practising a wide range of charitable 
activities. The unemployed of those days received either money, or gifts in 
kind, such as a pair of shoes and nailing, or 2-lb. of mutton, or ten bushels of 
coals. A man is paid thirty shillings for housing a 1,000 of turf for the poor, 
and another three shillings for digging and planting an old ladies’ garden. In 
lieu of death benefit a coffin is bought for a man to bury his wife, and the 
parson and clerk paid for bread and cheese and beer. A girl going to service is 
fitted out with a gown and petticoat, two aprons, one shift, one pair of 
stockings, two handkerchiefs, and a pair of pattens. A lad, likewise, with a 
smock frock and a jacket, a pair of "britcher", and a pair of stockings, while 
another has to be content with nine yards of calico and a fustian jacket.</p>
<b>
<p align="center">VISITING READING – AN ARDUOUS TASK</p>
</b>
<p>The benevolence of the overseer is not always confined to his own village, as 
is shown by his payment of sixpence to three sailors in distress. Two other 
interesting payments noted in the register are five shillings for "nockelating" 
a girl at Reading with the "cowpock", and sevenpence for the postage of a letter 
to Basingstoke. It is not surprising that the overseer often ended the year with 
the book in debt, necessitating an increase in the rate – a few shillings in 
those days. Later, some of the well-to-do inhabitants organized coal and 
clothing clubs, and hired out implements to those who had an extra plot of 
ground to cultivate. The often monotonous diet of the poor was augmented in the 
autumn by the "gleanings" or "leasings" which the family gathered after the 
harvest, and took to the mill to be exchanged weight for weight for flour. For 
recreation there were penny readings, mayings, and a cricket club towards the 
end of the century, the latter taking over the once flourishing rifle club. 
Visiting Reading was an arduous business. One either tramped the whole way, or 
got up at four in the morning to catch the carrier, arriving home at about eight 
o’clock at night.</p>
<p>The past forty years have seen many other changes in Arborfield life, but 
space, time and circumstances do not yet permit their narration here. </p>
