<p class="stbody">The <strong><a href="properties_bearwood.htm">Bearwood Estate</a></strong> 
was gradually built up by <strong><a href="families_john_walter_2.htm">John 
Walter II</a></strong> and <strong><a href="families_john_walter_3.htm">John 
Walter III</a></strong> from the profits made by <strong>'The Times'</strong> 
newspaper through most of the 19th Century. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">Sadly, the heir to the estate <strong>
	  <a href="families_john_walter_4.htm">John Walter IV</a></strong> was 
	  drowned when trying to save his brother and cousin when <strong>ice on 
	  Bearwood Lake broke on Christmas Eve 1870</strong>.&nbsp; His brother
	  <strong>Arthur Fraser Walter</strong> was considered a 'safe pair of hands', and by the time of 
	  his death in 1910, the Bearwood Estate covered over 10 square miles. Death 
	  duties forced Arthur's son <strong>John Walter V</strong> to put it up for 
	  sale in 1911.</p>
	  <p class="stbody">Land leased in 1904 to the Army for its <strong>Remount 
	  Depot</strong> was sold privately to the Government in 1911. Around half 
	  of the remaining land holdings, the so-called <strong>'outlying portions'</strong>, 
	  were parcelled up into 124 Lots and offered for sale over three days in 
	  March 1911. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">The stupendous <strong>
	  <a href="BW_1911_outlying_portions.htm">auction of the 'outlying portions'</a></strong>, 
	  held at the <strong>Drill Hall in Wokingham</strong> (itself a building 
	  owned by the Estate and forming one of the Lots in the sale), was reported 
	  in great detail in the local press. The sale was considered a relative 
	  failure because many Lots had failed to sell, while most of those that did 
	  were at low prices. However, other Lots were either sold before the 
	  auction took place, or after the auction had concluded.</p>

	  <img height="400" src="images/Bearwood/Bearwood_Auction_cover_July_1911.JPG" style="float: left" width="264"></a>The remainder of the Estate surrounding the Mansion and 
	  its ornamental parkland was offered for sale in five large Lots at an
	  <strong><a href="BW_1911_mansion_etc.htm">auction in London in July 1911</a></strong>. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong>Lot 1</strong> contained the <strong>Mansion and its 
	  parkland</strong>, plus <strong>St. Catherine's Lodge</strong>, plus the
	  <strong>model village of Sindlesham</strong>, plus <strong>King-Street Farm 
	  (Winnersh)</strong> and <strong>Bearwood Farm</strong> (later to be known as Scot's Farm, 
	  Woosehill); </p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong>Lot 2</strong> was an agricultural estate 
	  covering <strong>Randall's and Dowle's Farms</strong> on Barkham Road; </p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong>Lot 3</strong> was<strong> Barkham Manor House</strong> and 
	  grounds; </p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong>Lot 4</strong> was <strong>Barkham Square</strong> with 
	  <strong>Brook 
	  Farm</strong>; </p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong>Lot 5</strong> was described as a <strong>Sporting and 
	  Agricultural Estate</strong> including <strong>Rook's Nest Farm</strong>, lakes and woodland in 
	  Barkham and Finchampstead centred on what is now <strong>California Country Park</strong>. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">Although it had been hyped-up in the press as a possible home for royalty, 
	  the mansion failed to sell, and neither did the other four Lots, meaning 
	  that the Walter family remained at Bearwood for several more years.</p>
	  <p class="stbody">The map below shows the extent of the land included in 
	  the sale, with Barkham in the centre, Finchampstead to the south, and the 
	  parishes of Newland, Winnersh and Wokingham Without (Woosehill) to the 
	  north. Click on the map for a larger image.</p>
