<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 16pt">An Arborfield 
Tale</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Have you heard 
of <b>‘rough music’</b>, or the simile <b>‘like a tom-tit on a round of beef’</b>,
<b>or heard of a man getting a turd in his tea</b>?&nbsp; I learnt of all three when 
joining the group studying old documents at the Berkshire Local History 
Association’s day conference one Saturday in October 1981.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">My particular 
document&nbsp; (BRO reference D/EW1 L3)&nbsp; concerned the case of certain labourers from 
the Arborfield area accused of inciting a riot outside the small farm of Mr. 
Goble, who had been found striking his wife with a stick.&nbsp; Her offence was the 
evenings and nights spent at a neighbour’s by the name of Mr. Chandle, so Mr. 
Goble did appear to have a degree of grievance.&nbsp; It is possible, however, that 
the labourers were encouraged to riot by the local landlord, stirring up trouble 
against Goble’s landlord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The labourers 
pleaded that they were only following a custom of the neighbourhood called 
‘rough music’, which took place when a man resorted to violence against his 
wife.&nbsp; The men rang sheep bells, blew horns and banged pieces of iron outside 
the house to support the wife against the husband’s lack of gallantry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">When the ‘rough 
music’ continued for seven nights, however, the neighbours intervened and abuse 
and argument followed.&nbsp; Certain people were examined by lawyers for the 
landowners as witnesses, and amongst them was Richard Clark from Bearwood, who 
received a letter from an anonymous woman so full of lively abuse that I quote 
it in full.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The envelope 
has written on it<b>, ‘Richard Clark at Mr. Walters Garden House, Bear Wood.&nbsp; 
With Speed’</b>, and the letter reads:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><b>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">‘Richard Clark 
you must not be surprised of a few lines to you from one who is not such a fool 
as yourself and all the rest of you.&nbsp; I suppose you thought you was going to 
frighten the Arborfield young men but you was devilish mistaken.&nbsp; I wish they 
had given you a good ducking that’s what licktrenchers ought to have.&nbsp; I have 
not been to interfere with the Bear Wood fools not yet but I shall be there on 
Monday to meet all the Cowards at the wood.&nbsp; I shall see that five fools shall 
not fall upon one Arborfield man to tread his toes and scratch his face.&nbsp; As for 
that bit of a butler he looks like a tom tit on a round a Beef and there is 
George Hill another such a fool and Radband the same.&nbsp; I wonder that you are not 
afraid the timber falling upon you as you are Cutting it but I suppose the other 
men are oblige to instruct you as they see you are such a fool some delights in 
having a fool.&nbsp; As there is always one fool at play so I reckon you as such. So 
no more at present a friend to truth and a looker on I wrote it the postman 
brought it you paid for it law who would a thought it.&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><b>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Peep fool peep 
at your brother why shant one fool peep at another.&nbsp; I hope you will get served 
out for it.&nbsp; O you Cowards you bear Wood Cowards I hope you will get a good 
ducking for it you bear wood fools O you Cowards.&nbsp; If I was your wife you should 
not have a bit sugar in your tea I would put a turd in it to see if that would 
sweeten it that would make a Beautiful Flavour.&nbsp;</span></b></p>
