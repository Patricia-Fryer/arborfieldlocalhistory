        <p class="sthead">From the 'Reading Mercury', 31st January 1920:</p>

        <p class="sthead" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">New Home for 
        Seamen’s Children</font></span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Bear Wood and 500 acres of the 
        estate at Wokingham, Berks, which were recently sold by <b>Mr John 
        Walter</b>, chairman of “The Times” Publishing Co., have recently been 
        presented to the <b>Royal Merchant Seamen’s Orphanage</b> as the future 
        home of the institution. The donors are <b>Sir Thomas Lane Devitt</b>, 
        senior partner of the firm of Devitt &amp; Moore, shipowners, and <b>Sir 
        Alfred Yarrow</b>, head of the Clyde engineering and shipbuilding firm.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The present situation of the 
        orphanage and college is at <b>Snaresbrook, Essex</b>, where close on 
        300 boys and girls, orphans of merchant seamen, are being educated and 
        trained.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Bear Wood, an outlying part of 
        Windsor Forest, was originally purchased from the Crown by <b>John 
        Walter, son of the founder of “The Times”</b>, about the beginning of 
        the last [19<sup>th</sup>] century. The present house was built in the 
        early ‘sixties by <b>his son John Walter</b>, the third of the name, who 
        as chief proprietor controlled “The Times” from 1847 till his death in 
        1894, and was for over 30 years MP for Berkshire.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The mansion is in the late Tudor 
        style, and is exceedingly well built in red brick and stone. Mr Walter 
        was his own builder. The bricks used in the building were made on the 
        estate, and the whole of the woodwork for the interior was turned out at 
        the private workshops across the lake. The grounds are of great beauty, 
        and remarkable for their wealth of flowering shrubs, rhododendrons, 
        azaleas, and the like. The park, including the lake, extends to some 500 
        acres, and being situated in a beautiful and healthy part of the 
        country, the estate forms an ideal home for the children.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">From the house the lawn slopes down 
        to the lake, which is about 45 acres in extent. On one of the islands 
        stands a monument to the <b>eldest son of the third John Walter</b> – a 
        young man intended to succeed his father at Printing House Square – who 
        died, as an epitaph in Bear Wood Church records, ‘rescuing his brother 
        and cousin from the frozen lake at Bear Wood, Christmas Eve, 1870.’
        </span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The main building at Bear Wood will 
        provide accommodation for the children, but certain alterations and 
        additions will be required to make it fit to meet the special needs of 
        an institution. In due course the board of management will appeal to the 
        public for assistance in defraying the cost of these alterations. The 
        scheme is such a good one and the gift made by the donors of such a 
        generous nature that they are confident there will be a ready response 
        to any request for assistance to complete the good work.</span></p>

        There have been many additions over the years, not least the Chapel and 
        accommodation for boarders and staff.&nbsp; Unlike Arborfield Hall and 'Newlands', 
        both of which have vanished, </span>Bearwood Mansion<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
        and most of its outbuildings have survived, though the redundant 
        private </span>Gas-Works<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> has long since 
        gone. Some of the extensive grounds have had to earn their keep, having 
        been converted to Bearwood Golf Course, on Mole Road, and Bearwood Lakes 
        Golf Course, on the Bearwood Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that the College 
        grounds are private property. </span></b></p>
