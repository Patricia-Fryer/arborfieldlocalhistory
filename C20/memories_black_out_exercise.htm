<p>On April 1st 1939, the 'Mercury' announced plans for a simulated air raid, 
with a <b>'Black-Out exercise' to be held from midnight on Saturday May 6th to 3 
a.m. on Sunday May 7th</b>. </p>

<p>On <font size="2">April 8<sup>th</sup> the 'Reading Mercury' published a 
rather indistinct freehand-drawn '<i><b>map showing the area which would be involved in the 
A.R.P. test black-out on the night of May 6th-7th</b></i>', covering an area 
from Reading down to Alton and Liphook. It would encompass Arborfield:

<p>The 'Mercury' reported on May 13th the results of the simulation in the 
Reading area, while the 'Times and Weekly News' went into some detail on what 
happened in and around Wokingham:</p>
<font size="4"><b>
<p align="center">Biggest "Blackout" yet attempted</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Successful local organisation</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Ground exercises carried out under war conditions</p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>Britain’s biggest military zone can be made completely invisible. This 
conclusion may be drawn from the extensive "blackout" exercise carried out 
between midnight last Saturday and three o’clock Sunday morning, over a district 
which included <b>Aldershot</b>, <b>Farnborough</b>, <b>Camberley</b>, <b>
Sandhurst</b>, <b>Blackdown</b>, <b>Reading</b>, <b>Wokingham</b>, <b>Windsor</b>,
<b>Maidenhead</b>, <b>Bracknell</b> and <b>Ascot</b>. Thousands of troops and <b>
A.R.P.</b> volunteers carried out ground exercises under war conditions. </p>
<p><b>So effective was the "black-out" that R.A.F. pilots flying from Odiham, 
who are thoroughly familiar with the countryside, were unable to distinguish one 
town from another.</b></p>
<p>Within the <b>Aldershot Command</b>, lighting was under military orders and 
the consequent effectiveness of the darkness was hardly surprising. But the real 
feature of the test was the <b>enthusiastic co-operation of thousands of 
householders, shopkeepers and motorists</b>, who concealed or dimmed their 
lights to such an extent as to baffle experienced airmen. </p>
<p>For the first time the railway systems co-operated with the local 
authorities, proving that even on a bright moonlight morning such communications 
can be effectively concealed from the air. Both the <b>Great Western</b> and <b>
Southern Railways </b>reduced lighting at stations to the minimum. On the Great 
Western trains travelled with blinds drawn, and hoods were fitted over the 
cabins of locomotives to conceal the glare of the furnace. <b>Signal lights </b>
were kept going, but these could not be seen from the air.</p>
<p>Isolated lights from farmhouses and single cottages, and the occasional 
undimmed headlamps of a motorist in a hurry gave nothing away. Traffic lights 
were operated through slits, invisible from the air, street lights were 
extinguished, and war-time conditions were observed throughout the military and 
R.A.F. centres. Military observers expressed themselves well satisfied. The 
success of the "black-out" for <b>Reading</b> is extremely important, since it 
is generally known that this town would be an important civil centre in 
war-time.</p>
<p>A thick river mist which descended on parts of the area hampered the 
exercises at <b>Windsor</b> and <b>Maidenhead</b> but everything was carried 
through according to plan. The <b>Wokingham</b> and <b>Bracknell</b> areas were 
not quite so fortunate.</p>
<p align="center"><b>WEATHER UNFIT FOR PLANES</b></p>
<p>Aeroplanes were to have added to the realism of the operations in Wokingham, 
but as there was so much fog this was impossible. The ground exercises, however, 
went on as planned. All the A.R.P. Services in the Borough (except wardens on 
Post "A.4", "C.2", "B.1 and 2" and wardens other than the Post Warden of "B.3") 
took part. The Umpires and Producers for the incidents wore white arm bands 
marked A.R.P. in green. In a most realistic manner craters were indicated by 
white powder on the roads and notices indicating damage were posted at or near 
the sites.</p>
<p>The preliminary caution was received in Wokingham at 10 minutes past 
midnight; this was followed by the read message and the warning signal was then 
given. Although the enemy bombers did not pass over, the exercise went ahead and 
it was assumed that damage was done as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three Mustard Gas Bombs in <b>Waterloo Road</b>. 
 
  <li>Two H.E. Bombs in <b>Evendons Lane</b>; one hit No.120 (Post Office). 
        The house collapsed and there were casualties trapped alive under the 
        wreckage. There were three other casualties. The other bomb dropped in 
        the centre of the road about 20 yards west of the Post Office but did 
        not explode. 
 
  <li>H.E. bomb in <b>"Rose Court"</b> making crater in court. Nos. 1 and 2 were 
  set on fire and Nos. 4 and 5 collapsed. There were 5 casualties (2 stretcher 
  cases and three dead).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>"Raiders Passed"</b> signal was received and given at 10 to 1 a.m. and 
at 1.5 Warning of another expected raid was given and the Warning Signal 
sounded. At 1.15 another enemy formation should have crossed the borough and 
dropped bombs to do the following damage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two H.E. in Reading Road at <b>Bridge over the Emmbrook</b>, the North side of the 
        bridge collapsed reducing the road to one way traffic, the water main, 
        gas main and electric main were cut. Mill House collapsed and caught 
        fire – there were 5 other casualties, 3 being stretcher cases. 
 
  <li>Incendiary bombs on <b>Plough Inn, London Road</b>, set house on fire; 
        there were 4 casualties. 
 
  <li>Incendiary bombs on the wooden buildings in <b>Sales Nurseries, Woosehill 
  Lane</b>, should have 
        set the buildings on fire. 
 
  <li>Incendiary bombs in <b>Brickfields, Molly Millars Lane</b>, which was 
  presumed to have set fire to wooden buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Raiders Passed" signal was sounded at 2.15 and the All Clear (white) was 
received at 2.30 when the Exercise closed.</p>
<p align="center"><b>BRACKNELL, BINFIELD AND BILLINGBEAR</b></p>
<p>A "Times and Weekly News" representative reports as follows, on the 
activities in Bracknell, Binfield and Billingbear.</p>
<p>When one talks of A.R.P., one immediately thinks of the work that has been 
put in at Billingbear by <b>Mr. Read</b>. Therefore, the first point visited was 
the shelter and dugout built by him and his volunteers. Precisely at 12 o’clock 
we arrived at this noted landmark and were immediately met by Mr. Read and a B.P. 
Scout who was doing service during the midnight activity. Mr. Read volunteered 
to escort us around this shelter.</p>
<p>Upon entering we found ourselves in a room 5ft. by 6ft. which was evidently 
used for decontaminating purposes. The outer door was closed and the inner door 
opened and revealed numbers of people who were waiting for the beginning of 
activities. The first person met was <b>Mr. Sergeant</b> of the Red Cross who 
was keeping records of the casualties that arrived during these raids. <b>Miss 
Bayne Jardine</b> was in charge of the 1<sup>st</sup> aid assisted by <b>Miss 
Noel Read, S.R.N.</b>, late of Westminster Hospital. Eight others who had 
recently passed their test made up the party, who assisted those in charge.</p>
<p>In this second room one noticed a curtain drawn across what was evidently a 
doorway and upon drawing this aside, a door could be opened and immediate 
entrance was made to the dugout, which would hold about two persons. Electric 
lighting, water and sanitary arrangements had all been catered for. Mr. Read was 
justly proud of the work that he and his volunteers had so ably and skilfully 
put in.</p>
<p>The first high explosive dropped at <b>Billingbear Farm</b> about 12.15, and 
four volunteers became casualties. A later raid was made at the <b>Forest Lodge</b>. 
The response to the call for volunteers for this effort was excellent, great 
enthusiasm and interest being shown by all. The wardens who took road patrol did 
their work efficiently considering the inclemency of the weather.</p>
<p>The <b>Binfield Memorial Hall</b> was the next point visited. Here, we found 
Mrs. H. Rowe in charge, ably assisted by 12 Red Cross nurses and 15 volunteers 
who were casualties for this point. Three raids took place in this area and 
bombs fell at the following places: Col. Hume’s residence, Emmett Nest and a 
"Crossways". </p>
<p>A messenger brought the news to No. 4 Sector that at 12.48 a bomb was dropped 
at the <b>"Shoulder of Mutton"</b>, causing a crater. Screams were heard and 
wardens were sent out to ascertain the injuries. There were 3 casualties and 
they were sent on to the First Aid Station at the <b>Memorial Hall, Binfield</b>. 
At 1.20 a message was received that an air raid was on and at 1.47 a message was 
received that a bomb had fallen outside the <b>"Beehive"</b> and this was 
burning furiously. In the road were dark patches of liquid representing 
Phosgene. There were two casualties resulting from this who were then dispatched 
to the Memorial Hall where they received treatment.</p>
<p>The main first aid station was then visited at the <b>Church House, Bracknell</b>. 
This was under the supervision of <b>Miss Ford</b> of Bracknell, who is attached 
to the Berkshire Red Cross Society. Here were received all the more serious 
casualties from 10 other first aid points and, when these had been redressed 
they were dispatched to hospital. <b>Dr. Turner</b> was also in attendance at 
this point. The recorder of casualties for the <b>Red Cross</b> was <b>Mrs. 
Templeman</b>. Here also was a small detachment of the <b>St. John Nursing 
Association</b> under the supervision of <b>Mrs. Green</b> who also kept the 
record of casualties for this detachment. Bombs were dropped at Bracknell 
Station and the <b>International Stores, High Street</b>. Both of these raids 
were carried out with high explosives.</p>
<p>The St. John Ambulance Brigade under the control of Mr. Green was rendering 
able assistance in bringing in cases that were more serious in a number of 
private cars and also a <b>specially fitted out lorry</b> belonging to <b>
Messrs. Drake and Mount</b> for stretcher cases, and also the regular ambulance 
was put into active service. A call was made upon the Fire Brigade during this 
raid. </p>

<p>Letters on May 12th:</p>
<p align="center"><b>WOKINGHAM BOROUGH AND AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS</b></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In my opinion I think that everything went off as well as could be expected. 
The "Black-out" was organised by the Aldershot Command and our Exercise was 
prepared under their direction, practically all the personnel of the Wokingham 
Borough A.R.P. were on duty.</p>
<p>It must be realised that under the circumstances it is more difficult to 
carry out an Exercise of this description in peace time especially at night when 
"make believe" has to be resorted to, to such a great extent – taking this into 
consideration, the Services carried on their duties remarkably well.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone present for turning out and carrying out their 
duties in the spirit they did. I have also received a letter from Major General 
Collins, the County A.R.P. Officer who has asked me to convey his cordial thanks 
to all who took part and also to make this Exercise as practical a one as 
possible. </p>
<p>Yours Faithfully, J. H. Titterington, A.R.P.Controller. </p>
<p align="center"><b>WOKINGHAM RURAL DISTRICT COUNCIL</b></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I would be much obliged if you would allow me the use of your columns to say 
a few words of appreciation to all those who took part in the A.R.P. exercise on 
the night of May 6<sup>th</sup>/7<sup>th</sup>, in the Wokingham Rural Area.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to personally thank everybody who turned out, on 
what, in some cases, may have seemed a tedious job, but I hope that everyone who 
reads this, will realise that the mere fact of having gone to their allotted 
post, is part of the training we all have to undergo, to fit ourselves to take 
our places in case of an emergency, and it is only by an exercise such as this, 
that those who are trying to get the organisation to run smoothly, can find out 
by any mistakes, which have been made, where that organisation can be improved.</p>
<p>Thanking you in anticipation, Mr. Editor, I am, Yours Faithfully, J. N. Bald, 
A.R.P. Controller.</p>
