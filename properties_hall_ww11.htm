        <p class="stbody">The Hall was occupied firstly by the RAF and then by 
        the American 
        forces during the <b>Second World War</b>. Its grounds were also home to 
        a top-secret <b><a href="properties_hall_decoy.htm">decoy site</a></b> known as a 'Starfish'.</p>

        J Carter</b> wrote to the Parish Council in 1999 to provide details of 
        life at <b>Arborfield Hall</b> in the Second World War. The Headquarters 
        Unit of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Advanced Air Depot Area (2<sup>nd</sup>. 
        A.A.D.A.) of the U.S. 9<sup>th</sup> Air Force was stationed at the 
        Hall. It had been formed in autumn 1943 at Bushey Park in north London, 
        and moved to Arborfield on December 15<sup>th</sup> that year. There 
        were about 50 officers and 200 enlisted men. They departed from the Hall 
        on June 15<sup>th</sup> 1944, going into Normandy over <b>Omaha Beach</b>.</p>
        <p class="stbody">He recollected that Arborfield Hall was a beautiful 
        old building which served as the HQ and offices. There were a number of 
        other buildings on the grounds, the most memorable apart from the Hall 
        being <b>the Grange</b>. It was located about an 1/8<sup>th</sup> of a 
        mile from the Hall and was where the Officers ate their meals. He 
        recalled that the Grange was a large home with a small lake beside it, 
        surrounded by many trees and bushes.</p>
        <p class="stbody">There were no barracks on the grounds, so they were 
        all billeted with English families near by. Thomas could not remember 
        the name of the lovely English couple he stayed with, but they were 
        wonderful to him. A hot cup of English Tea would be on the dresser each 
        morning. At the time, he was in his early 20’s and thought of them as 
        elderly, but they were probably only in their mid 40’s. He laughed about 
        this impression for years, because by 1999 he himself was approaching 
        81. He did remember that the couple lived across the street from a 
        Friends Boys School. Being a Birth Right Quaker, he had gone over to 
        visit them.</p>
        <p class="stbody">Thomas wrote again after receiving copies of 
        photographs of Arborfield Hall. "It seems to me, that I remember that 
        the lower floor of Arborfield Hall contained what looked to be prison 
        cells. As your information indicates, perhaps these were not prison 
        cells at all, but were used for the storage of wine, beer and whiskey. 
        May I assure you, that when we arrived at Arborfield Hall, those cells 
        were empty".</p>
