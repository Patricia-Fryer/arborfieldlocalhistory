<p>On Friday September 1st 1939, the 'Times and Weekly News' gave a good 
pen-picture of the new Army Technical School, just two days before censorship 
prevented all but the barest of detail on military developments: </p>
<font size="3"><b>
<p align="center">The Army in the Making</p>
<p align="center">Activity At Arborfield</p>
<p align="center">Wokingham’s Neighbouring Garrison</p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>Stretches of reinforced concrete roads, rows of galvanised iron buildings and 
continuous building activity almost as far as the eye can see – is one’s first 
impression of the <b>Army Technical School at Arborfield</b> – the boy’s camp.</p>
<p>The first started and now complete, this school is the last word in comfort.
<b>Electric light, central heating, sprung beds</b> – the boys’ first experience 
of Army life is probably vastly different from what they expected. Most of the 
lads are between 14 – 18 and at present there are <b>500 of them under training</b>. 
It is understood that the full complement is <b>1,000</b> and it is expected 
this number will be there by the end of October.</p>
<p><b>Gymnasiums, billiard tables, football, rugby and cricket pitches</b> – 
these boys have plenty to amuse them when their work is done. In course of 
erection is a huge building which is to be a <b>dance hall and cinema</b> and 
will seat 1,000. </p>
<p>Every facility for instruction is provided – the <b>workshops and machine 
shops</b> being the last word in modern efficiency. As yet there is no band at 
this camp and Band Marches are relayed to the large parade ground from 
gramophone records amplified through loud speakers. Education facilities are 
provided by the War Office and a <b>well equipped hospital</b> attends to any 
minor accident or illness. </p>
<p>At present the <b>A. A. Militia, comprising 1,100 men and Reservists in 4 
Batteries</b>, have not been afforded the comfort of built quarters and they are
<b>under canvas</b>. There is however, feverish activity on the part of the 
contractors in erecting and completing the <b>wooden buildings</b> that will 
very shortly "house" these men, it is to be hoped before the winter arrives.</p>
<p>Nearing completion too are the <b>married quarters</b> which closely resemble 
a vast housing estate [Valon Road]. <b>Officers' quarters</b> are rapidly being 
built and before very long the entire camp should be completely finished and it 
is understood will comprise over <b>20,000 people</b>. When this time comes then 
we expect the effect on Wokingham will be such that there will be an <b>influx 
of new traders</b>.</p>

<p>The Army Technical School was in the news several times during the war; this 
item from the 'Times and Weekly News' was careful not to identify the location:</p>
<p>July 11th 1941: <b>A.T.S. Annual Sports</b>: On Tuesday and Wednesday of last 
week, a local Technical School held its Annual Sports Day. [long list of 
winners].</p>
<p>The 'Reading Mercury' of July 10th 1943 was more specific: <b>Arborfield: 
Army Technical School Gymkhana</b>. The Army Technical School, Arborfield, held 
their annual Gymkhana on Saturday, when the fruits of keen training were shown 
in the fitness, athletic skill, drill and discipline on parade of the boys, 
whose ages ranged from 14 to 17 [… list of winners].</p>
<p>This was followed later in the month with news of another sporting event, on July 31st:</p>
<p> <b>Arborfield:</b> <b>Boxing Medals Presented</b>: The Army 
Technical School (Boys) received a visit from <b>Major General R. Evans, C.B., 
M.C.</b>, Commanding, Aldershot District, on Sunday morning, when he presented 
medals to the winners and runners-up of the Schools’ boxing competition. [… List 
of winners, plus ‘Best Loser’].</p>
<p>The 'Times and Weekly News' announced on August 25th 1943 that the Commandant of 
the Army Technical School was moving on: </p>
<p><b>Organised the A.T.S. At Arborfield: Brigadier F. A. Hillborn</b>, 
A.M.Inst.M.E., has been appointed Commandant of the Gordon Boys’ School. 
Brigadier Hillborn, after serving in the Royal Engineers, Royal Tank Corps and 
the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, was selected in 1939 to organise the new <b>Army 
Technical School</b> for boys at Arborfield, and was appointed by the War Office its 
first Commandant and Chief Instructor. At the Gordon Boys’ School, boys from 13 
to 17 are trained in various trades, including engineering and motor mechanics 
for both civil and service careers.</p>
<p>On October 16th, there was a long article: <b>‘Boys taught a trade – 
Apprenticed to Army’</b>, plus a photo: '<b>Boys of the Army Technical School</b>, 
Berkshire, being trained in watch-makers’ lathe work. They are taught to turn 
out precision instruments.':</p>

<p>Peace was just around the corner on April 14th 1945, when the 'Mercury' 
published the following photo: <b>'Members of the Army Cadet Force</b>, 
undertaking a week’s course on "Mechanical Transport" at a R.E.M.E. Technical 
Training Centre, are shown repairs to a Bren carrier'.</p>

<p>After VE-Day, the emphasis switched to a new era, when a Housing and Planning 
Exhibition was held at the Army Technical School. The 'Mercury' included 
photographs of the event in two successive weeks in June 1945.</p>
<p>June 2nd: '<b>Soldiers </b>showing keen interest in the electricity section 
of the <b>Housing and Planning Exhibition</b> held at the R.E.M.E. School, 
Arborfield':</p>

        <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
       
<p>On July 7th 1945, the 'Mercury' reported: <b>Army Technical School Sports</b>: 
<i>Many hundreds of people, including the Mayors and Mayoresses of Reading and 
Wokingham, attended the annual sports and gymkhana of the Army Technical School 
at Arborfield on Saturday. A large part of the audience was comprised of the 
parents and relatives of the boys who took part, and they must have felt proud 
at the fine display given. The boys were certainly a great credit to those 
responsible for their training.</i></p>
<p><i>The band of the School was much appreciated, and it added colour to the many 
marching displays. There were several novelty races and displays. A very fine 
junior P.T. display was given by boys of only four months’ service. Highland 
dancing was performed by <b>Private Robertson</b>, of the Army Dental Corps. Other 
items including chair tricks, novelty cycle relay race, inter-company 
tug-of-war, parents’ and sons’ race, company staff relay race, a children’s race 
and a senior physical training display.</i></p>
<p><i>The trophies were presented by <b>Lady Hill</b>, whose husband <b>
Major-General Sir Basil Hill</b>, a former Rugby International, was also 
present.</i> [list of prize winners]</p>

        In Autumn 1945, under peace-time conditions, the boys of the School were 
        on parade as shown in this photo from the 'Mercury' of October 20th:</p>
