        <p class="stbody">The people of Arborfield used to hold their social 
        gatherings at the School, but this wasn't ideal, because there wasn't a 
        separate hall. Through the 1920's there were plans for a<a href="../images/new"><img border="1" hspace="5" alt="The Village Hall in Eversley Road" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/new/VH_front_TN.jpg" width="214" height="143"></a> 
        Village Hall, and finally in late 1931, it opened. </p>

        <p class="stbody">Because at the time there were two parish councils (<b>Arborfield
        </b>and <b>Newland</b>), the hall was to be administered by a separate
        <b>Management Committee</b> (see the <b>
        <a href="http://www.arborfield.org.uk/">Parish Council web-site</a></b> 
        and select '<b>Village Hall</b>').</p>

        <p class="stbody">From the start, it was hoped to extend the main hall 
        rearwards, but to this day, the wooden panelling at the back has 
        remained in place, though there is an extension to accommodate the 
        surgery, waiting room and Parish Council office. </p>

        <p class="stbody">Here's how the 'Reading Mercury' reported the opening 
        ceremony in its October 17th issue:</p>

        site i<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Miss Beatrice Simonds opening the new Village Hall with a golden key" vspace  =5 align=right src="../images/Collier/VH_Miss_Simonds.JPG" width=258 height=306 >n 
        the centre of the village given by the late <b>
        <a href="../families_simonds_john3.htm">Mr. John Simonds</a></b>, a 
        Reading Freeman, was opened on Saturday afternoon by <b>Miss B. M. 
        Simonds</b>. As honorary secretary of the building committee and 
        president of the Women’s Institute, Miss Simonds was prominent in a 
        great many efforts to raise a sufficiently large amount of money for the 
        provision of a hall that would serve as a social centre for the whole 
        village and as a headquarters for most of its institutions. </p>
        <p>For more than five years the business of collecting money by 
        subscription and by means of public events has increased steadily, and 
        the result is that Arborfield has much better provision than many 
        villages can boast of for its social work.</p>
        <p>The building was designed by <b>Mr. W. H. Howell</b>, F.R.I.B.A, of 
        Reading, and erected by <b>F. J. Milam</b> of Finchampstead. It consists 
        of a new hall, 32 ft by 26 ft, with dressing rooms, kitchen and 
        boiler-house. The walls are brick-built and the roof is tiled. Funds did 
        not permit of any elaboration or ornament, but the building was designed 
        to be in keeping with its surroundings. It has accommodation for 180 and 
        the rear wall has been erected to allow for an extension whichmight 
        bring the accommodation to 250. Almost all of the men employed were from 
        the locality.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><font size="3">Prominent Workers</font></b></p>
        <p><b>Canon J. A. Anderson</b>, the chairman of the committee, who never 
        spares himself in any work for the welfare of his parishioners, has once 
        again earned the gratitude of the whole village by his encouragement and 
        his example in working for the hall, and when Miss Simonds left 
        Arborfield, the building committee were fortunate to find as her 
        successor a secretary as competent and popular as <b>Mr. J. C. P. 
        Allsebrook</b>. Throughout the effort <b>
        <a href="../families_death_JHSimonds.htm">Mr. J. H. Simonds</a></b> has 
        also been an active worker, taking on the responsibility of treasurer 
        and making good a promised gift of his father, after the death of Mr. 
        John Simonds. </p>
        <p>The other members of the committee, all of whom assisted very 
        materially in the work, were <b>Mrs. Prescott</b>, <b>Mrs. Allsebrook</b>,
        <b>Mrs. Verrall</b>, <b>Mrs. Garratt</b>, <b>Captain Hart</b>, <b>Mrs. 
        Crocker</b>, <b>Mr. Rogers</b> and <b>Mr. Duffield</b>.</p>

        <p align="center"><b><font size="3">The late Mr. Simonds’ Interest.</font></b></p>
        <p>Canon Anderson presided at the opening ceremony outside the hall. He 
        said that in his earliest days at Arborfield, people spoke about the 
        need for a village hall, and after the war the need became more pressing 
        than ever. In 1926, as chairman of the parish council, he consulted the 
        late <b><a href="../families_simonds_john3.htm">Mr. John Simonds</a></b>, who was chairman of Newland Parish Council, as to 
        what action should be taken. Mr. Simonds was at once in favour of 
        erecting a hall, provided it was a building worthy of the village, and 
        later <b><a href="../families_death_JHSimonds.htm">Mr. J. H. Simonds</a></b> informed them that his father would start the 
        fund with £100.</p>
        <p>Canon Anderson spoke of various efforts that had taken place to raise 
        £1,000 or more. He said that no less than 200 people had taken part, and 
        another £100 was contributed by Mr. Simonds, who also gave the site. "It 
        has been well worth our while to have worked and waited so long to have 
        a hall of a permanent character, and it is something of the ideal that 
        the late Mr. John Simonds set before us from the very first", Canon 
        Anderson added.</p>
        <p>The Architect, <b>Mr. W. R. Howell</b>, also spoke. He said the building was 
        designed to be in keeping with the village and was not like the flaring 
        cinemas that spoiled the streets of so many towns. It was a building 
        reposeful and useful. The workmen who had been engaged on the building 
        were mostly local men, and they did their work in the spirit of the old 
        English craftsmen; they seemed to take a pride in it, and in doing it 
        as well as could be done. </p>
        <p align="center"><b><font size="3">Golden Key for Miss Simonds</font></b></p>
        <p>Mr. Howell then handed to Miss Simonds a golden key with which to 
        unlock the door. After doing so, Miss Simonds said she knew that if the 
        late Mr. Simonds were with them, he would be pleased to see that they 
        had erected such a splendid building. He was anxious that it should be a 
        credit to the village and not an eyesore, and all who had shared in the 
        work could feel that they had helped to build a hall they could be proud 
        of.</p>

        <p>After prayer, the company gathered in the hall, where their first act 
        was to sing the National Anthem, following which little <b>Ann Bentley</b> 
        presented a bouquet to Miss Simonds. Mr. J. H. Simonds made a statement 
        on the financial position. By the initial effort of the village, it had 
        been possible, he said, to erect and very nearly pay for the village 
        hall. By means of subscriptions and proceeds from various efforts £918 
        had been raised. This had yielded £71 interest, and another £150 in 
        subscriptions had been promised. In addition to that they would require 
        £50, This could be borrowed from the bank, and he appealed to all to 
        wipe off this debt as soon as possible. In conclusion, Mr. Simonds 
        expressed the thanks of Miss Simonds for the honour they had done her in 
        selecting her to perform the opening ceremony. He regarded it as a 
        compliment to her and to the family.</p>
        <p><b>Mr. Alan Bentley</b> proposed a vote of thanks to Miss Simonds for 
        opening the hall, and spoke of the active interest which Miss Simonds 
        had always taken in the life of the village.</p>
        <p>The hall was decorated with flowers for the ceremony, this being the 
        work of <b>Miss Prescott</b> and <b>Miss Allsebrook</b>.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><font size="3">Management Council</font></b></p>
        <p>A management council has been formed to take charge of the hall. It 
        is representative of various organisations in the villages, as follows: 
        - <br><br><b>Mr. G. Allsebrook</b>, Arborfield Parish Council; <br><b>Mr. J. H. Simonds</b>, 
        Newland Parish Council; <br><b>Mrs. Prescott</b>, managers of Arborfield, Newland 
        and Barkham School; <br><b>Miss Jervoise</b>, nursing Association; <br>
        <b>Mrs. Verrall</b>, 
        Women’s Institute; <br><b>Mr. F. E. Stokes</b>, Young Men’s Club; <br>
        <b>Mr. Gutteridge</b>, 
        British Legion; <br><b>Captain Hart</b>, Horticultural Association; <br>
        <b>Mr. Guy 
        Bentley</b>, Cricket Club; <br><b>Mrs. Allsebrook</b>, Girl Guides; <br>
        <b>Canon Anderson</b>, Boy 
        Scouts; <br><b>Mr. J. C. P. Allsebrook</b> is also secretary of this committee. </p>

        <p>There has always been a need to supplement income by fund-raising, to 
        provide improvements, extensions and for maintenance. At the time this 
        article was prepared in August 2008, the Hall was surrounded by 
        scaffolding while the main roof was replaced. The first photo shows the 
        front of the building, complete with concrete flower-tub to protect the 
        car-park. On the left is the boiler-house with its tall chimney, no 
        longer strictly necessary.</p>

        <p>The second photo shows the rear extension. It's not possible without 
        extensive tree surgery to try to get the same viewpoint as Mr. Collier 
        enjoyed in 1931, so this view was taken from the other side of the 
        building.</p>
