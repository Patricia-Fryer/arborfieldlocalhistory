        <p class="stbody">
        This is School Road, showing what was then known as 'Newland, Arborfield and Barkham Schools'. 
        The&nbsp; School House was occupied by the headmaster, Mr. Verrall, who 
        retired a year later. Here is an article from the 'Reading Standard' of 
        11th July 1947:</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <i>&quot;</i><font style="font-size: 9pt"><i>Mr W J Verrall, Headmaster of 
        Arborfield Church of England Schools, who is retiring at the end of the 
        summer term, has been teaching for 42 years.</i></p>

        <p><i>&quot;Certificated in 1905, he held his first appointment at St. 
        Peter’s Boys School, Bexhill-on-Sea; spent five years at Palmer School, 
        Wokingham; and nine years broken by two years’ war service, at Brimpton 
        Church of England School near Newbury; finally coming to Arborfield in 
        May 1921: a total of 40 years teaching in Berkshire.</i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Mr Verrall has always entered fully into all the social and other 
        activities of the village. He was hon. secretary of the Cricket Club 
        from 1921 – 37; treasurer of the British Legion 1922 – 44; hon. 
        secretary of the Flower Show for fifteen years; a Parish Councillor 
        since 1940, and chairman of Newland Parish Council during the past year; 
        chairman of the Village Hall Management Committee, the Library 
        Committee, and the local branch of the National Savings Committee; agent 
        for the Royal Berks Friendly Society; and a member of the Royal Observer 
        Corps for nine years. </i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;A Church Warden and a member of the Parochial Church Council, Mr 
        Verrall has been a choir member for fifty years, including a period as 
        Choirmaster at Barkham.</i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Mrs Verrall, who was also a teacher before her marriage, is a 
        member of the Mothers’ Union, the British Legion Women’s Section, and 
        for many years was secretary of the Women’s Institute.&quot;</i></p>
        </font>

        <p class="stbody">
        Further to the right is Langley Pond Farm and Wood Lane. As plans 
        progressed for the yet-to-be-named 'School Road' housing site in early 
        1947, it was announced that a new sewage works would be built on land 
        behind Langley Pond Farm, initially to serve this estate. It was some 
        years later before the houses near the 'Bramshill Hunt' were to be 
        connected, despite the desperate need for something to replace their 
        overflowing cesspit.&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        The field opposite the School was developed into Emblen Crescent, as 
        shown in another aerial photo taken in 1985. Note the alley-way leading 
        to School Road in the bottom right-hand corner:</p>
