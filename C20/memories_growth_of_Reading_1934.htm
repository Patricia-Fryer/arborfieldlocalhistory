      <p><strong>Ernest&nbsp;Dormer</strong> wrote the 
      <strong>'Notes and Queries'</strong> 
      history series in the <strong>'Reading Mercury'</strong>      
       during the 1930s, continuing the tradition set&nbsp;by his 
      predecessor <strong><a href="families_Ditchfield.htm">Peter 
      Ditchfield</a></strong> .&nbsp;Ernest had contributed articles on the history of 
      Arborfield and the <strong>Old Church</strong> since at least <strong><a 
      href="../church_old_Dormer.htm">1907</a></strong>, and continued 
      with the historical column until his death in 1940, aged        
                   
                  
              75. </p>
      <p>On March 17th 1934, Mr. Dormer speculated about 
      the future growth of Reading, imagining its boundaries 50 years hence. He 
      had no knowledge of any plans for a <strong><a 
      href="../properties_motorways.htm">motorway south of Reading</a></strong>, 
      and expected the 'city of Reading' to have reached the northern border of 
      <strong>Arborfield</strong> 
      by&nbsp;1984. Actually, the <strong>M4</strong>     effectively 
      marked the southern boundary of greater Reading until around the end of 
      the 20th century, but this has now been breached with developments in 
      <strong>Shinfield</strong>         
               
                   
                  
              village. </p>
      <p>The 'Reading Mercury' was already reporting 
      on&nbsp;the troubling events in Germany, and inviting its more affluent 
      readers to take a special Thomas Cook's tour&nbsp;to see the country for 
      themselves. It had also reported on&nbsp;<strong>Fascist meetings</strong>       
                
                 
               in 
      Reading, and carried readers' letters on the desirability or otherwise 
      of&nbsp;dictatorship in the&nbsp;U.K. Of course, the coming <strong><a 
      href="memories_newspapers_WWII.htm">World War</a></strong> 
      affected&nbsp;Reading's growth&nbsp;for a couple 
      of decades, as hinted by&nbsp;Mr. Dormer&nbsp;at the <strong><a href="#Utopia">end of the 
      essay</a></strong>.&nbsp;A legacy of WWII was the&nbsp;designation of 
      <strong><a 
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_London_Heathrow_Airport">Heathrow</a></strong> 
      as London's airport; international airliners regularly 'stack' above 
      <strong>Woodley&nbsp;Beacon</strong>, awaiting their turn to 
      land&nbsp;when the wind is blowing from the east.&nbsp;<strong><a 
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Berkshire_Aviation">Woodley&nbsp;Aerodrome</a></strong> 
      was a major airfield for training and aircraft manufacture during WWII, 
      but although several of the buildings still exist, the airfield has long 
      since been covered with factories and

      illustrations), plus a couple of others from the <strong>'Reading

               </p>
      <p>It must be obvious, even to the casual observer, 
      that the <strong>Borough of Reading</strong> is entering upon another of 
      those forward movements which have marked its growth from an agricultural 
      to an industrial town in the last hundred years. No one can walk through 
      <strong>Broad Street</strong> without being conscious of a vitality which 
      was not apparent even ten years ago. And if we go back forty years the 
      advance is startling. It is not that the population is noticeably 
      increasing – Reading has not reached the hundred 
      thousand mark yet – but there are cumulative signs that speak of an 
      increase in business and a rapid extension of the area which the 
      town, by its geographical situation, is designed to serve. </p>
      <p>Rural remoteness is now a thing of the past; 
      accessibility to main centres easy and comfortable. And this conscious 
      animation in Reading is not wholly due to the advent of commercial 
      enterprise, of national rather than local origin, which has come to 
      speed the advance in the centre of the town. For some psychological reason 
      not easy to fathom, Reading has always grown to the south and 
      west with more willingness than in any other direction. </p>
      <p>The ancient <strong>Hundred of Reading</strong> 
      lay mainly to the west and the north-west; and the early settlement 
      certainly had no interest in the east. Reading was a Kennet town and a 
      hedge and a ditch for possibly over a thousand years were sufficient to 
      separate it from the manors of the great ecclesiastical overlords on the 
      eastern side. But in 1911, a more spectacular thrust was made to the 
      north, and the ancient boundary of <strong>Wessex and Mercia</strong>        
           was crossed. Moreover, what is sometimes forgotten by 
      the man in the street, part of the County of Oxford was 
      bitten out and added to the County of Berks. </p>
      <p>It may appear to some surprising that the more 
      formidable natural boundary of the <strong>Thames</strong>    should have been crossed 
      in preference to an easier and arbitrary boundary on the east and south-east, 
      but to those who move in the technical domain of rateable values 
      and borrowing powers the explanation is a simple one. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>PRESENT DEVELOPMENT A 
      BEGINNING.</strong>        
                   
                  
               </p>
      <p>And this specious explanation probably accounts 
      for the previous move of 1887 to the south and west and the partial intake 
      of <strong>Earley</strong>, when only half a mile or so to the east and a 
      little more to the south-east were added by that extension. But building 
      had already proceeded apace on the northern side of the main London road 
      beyond the <strong>Marquis of Granby</strong>, anciently the 
      <strong>Gallows Tavern</strong>        
              , and the Earley Rise 
      and Mockbeggar estates were in process of a development similar to that 
      which now marks other areas in the same neighbourhood. </p>
      <p>Some weeks ago there appeared in the Press a 
      series of excellent photographs showing what is already happening in 
      Earley. It is clear that this is only a beginning, but it is symptomatic 
      of a mighty movement which has gripped many a field and meadow and orchard 
      on the <strong>Great West Road beyond Colnbrook</strong>        
                   
         , and we are being forced to the conclusion 
      that Reading is nearer London than its mileage connotes. </p>
      <p>The giant octopus is throwing out its tentacles in 
      an alarming manner. When the next borough extension comes, what are the 
      areas likely to be incorporated and what are the historical details which will 
      help to swell the dossier of him who writes a history of Reading 
      half a century hence? Let us attempt the journey and, as it 
      were, beat the imaginary bounds of that future city. </p>
      <p>The extension of 1887 took in on the eastern side 
      parts of two ancient manors – <strong>Earley St. Bartholomew</strong> and 
      <strong>Earley St. Nicholas</strong>. Included was a portion of the old 
      <strong>Common Fields of Earley</strong>, which had remained for probably 
      a thousand years within the bounds of this liberty. The <strong>Southern 
      railway</strong>, from near the <strong>Kennet mouth</strong>, provided a 
      simple, ready-made line of demarcation as far as <strong>Church Road, 
      Earley</strong>. I do not propose to 
      labour the historic interest of this small section, as I have frequently 
      dealt with it in these columns, but I would repeat an observation I made 
      some time ago when dealing with the <strong><a href="#Kennet">site of a 
      forgotten wharf at the confluence of the two rivers</a></strong>            
                    
                   
                 , that the 
      liberty appears to have been a buffer state between a rural demesne and an 
      ecclesiastical lordship, and its separate mention in Domesday Book 
      may be taken to indicate an important settlement quite independent of Reading or 
      Sonning. Its extensive Common Fields would seem to point to a much 
      greater population than were resident here in post-medieval times. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>SOME FIFTY YEARS 
      HENCE.</strong>        
                   
                  
               </p>
      <p>But let us try to visualise the new Reading of 
      some fifty years hence. Our bounds can only be approximate and the area to 
      be incorporated in the next great drive to the east, south-east and south 
      may prove to be incorrect in parts, for many considerations have to be 
      taken into account when owners of land are called upon to share the cost 
      of urbanising a rural district. It is as well to have a <em>point 
      d'apput</em>, and we will take <strong>Loddon Bridge</strong>, on the<strong>Wokingham Road</strong>

      <p> Whatever happens either side of this ancient 
      crossing, the extended borough will have to reach to here. In doing so it 
      will incorporate parts of two existing parishes, <strong>Earley</strong> 
      and <strong>Woodley</strong>, for the boundary between these two liberties 
      crosses the main <strong>Forest Road</strong> at a spot near 
      <strong>Hungerford Lodge</strong>     
                   
                   
                 
                    
              
                   
                  
              . </p>
      <p> Now let us take another point of contact: 
      <strong>Spencers Wood</strong>, on the southern or <strong>Basingstoke 
      Road</strong>. The <strong>Loddon</strong> crosses the road at 
      <strong>Swallowfield Mill</strong>, and on the northern side of the river 
      we are in<strong> Shinfield</strong>     
                   
                   
                 
                    
              
                   
               parish, parts of 
      which abut on Reading near the Merry Maidens Inn. </p>
      <p>It is obvious that there would be a huge 
      absorption if the <strong>Loddon</strong>  
              is to 
      bound the new Reading between Swallowfield Mill and Loddon Bridge, but the fact remains 
      that rapid development is proceeding, or will proceed, on 
      many of the sites in this neighbourhood, which are

      education, lighting and the many amenities of a borderline urban 
      population will have to be faced in the not very distant future. And no 
      town contemplating expansion can ignore those “lungs” which modern 
      civilisation has now decreed to be a necessity rather        
                   
                  
            than a luxury. </p>
      <p>But a less ambitious project may suffice on the 
      south and south-east, and in this event we could take a road running east 
      and north through <strong>Hyde End</strong> and <strong>School 
      Green</strong>, after which there would be a choice either by the 
      <strong>Parrot Farm road</strong> to the Loddon again and thence to Loddon 
      Bridge, or going a little further north, along <strong>Cutbush 
      Lane</strong>, taking in much of Lower Earley and thence via <strong>Mill 
      Road</strong> and <strong>Loddon Mill</strong> [Sindlesham] to the        
                   
                  
              bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>THE MUNICIPAL 
      AERODROME.</strong>        
                   
                  
               </p>
      <p>We are now back to our <em>point d'apput</em> and 
      will proceed north-east. There is a very old road leading from the inn 
      known as the <strong>George and Dragon</strong> which is bifurcated about 
      two hundred yards along its course. The left-hand way leads through to 
      <strong>Sonning</strong> and <strong>Wheelers Green</strong>; the 
      right-hand way to <strong>Coleman's Moor Farm</strong> and 
      <strong>Sandford Mill</strong>, then to <strong>Hurst</strong> and 
      <strong>Twyford</strong>. So great an extension as the whole of Sonning 
      may probably not at this stage be contemplated; but the development of the 
      <strong>Erleigh Court</strong> and <strong>Holme Farm</strong>          
                    
                  
                  
                   
                   
                      estates will 
      have some effect on this. We will tentatively assume that Sonning is not 
      in the picture, so at some point about Sandford Mill the river 
      must be abandoned and an arbitrary boundary picked up. </p>
      <p>Now, aviation will in future play an increasingly 
      important part in town planning and urban organisation, and with the 
      increase of private flying different ideas in regard to distance and 
      accessibility will arise, just as they arose when the 
      <strong>railway</strong> and the internal combustion engine came to shape 
      and dominate the life and livelihood of the community. One can therefore 
      envisage <strong>municipal aerodromes</strong> on a large scale in or near 
      any centre of importance. At <strong>Woodley</strong>        
                 
                 
                  
                 
               
                   
                   
                  
              
                   
            there is the obvious site of 
      the future town landing ground for the extended borough. </p>
      <p>We should, therefore, be disposed to take a fairly 
      wide detour at this point, and still leaving the Loddon in its capricious 
      and beautiful ways through <strong>Whistley</strong>, pick up a point on 
      the <strong>Great Western Railway</strong> near <strong>Sonning Golf 
      Course</strong>        
                 
                 
                  
                 
               
                   
                   
                  
              
                   
                and follow 
      the line to the present boundary of the town. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>AN ALTERNATIVE.</strong>        
                   
                  
               </p>
      <p>It might be argued that this is undesirable since 
      it leaves the <strong>Earley Mead</strong> and the new <strong>electrical 
      transformer station</strong>, and even the site of the <strong>Reading Gas 
      Company's new gas holder</strong>         
                  
                   
               
                  
                    
               , in alien territory. If 
      this be considered undiplomatic or inadvisable the alternative is to take the present boundary between Sonning and 
      Earley and proceed to Earley Point on the Thames. One could then come 
      down the centre of the river to the Kennet Mouth and join 
      with the existing boundary at the Southern Railway bridge. </p>
      <p>There would be a distinct advantage in this 
      arrangement since it is highly desirable that the historic Earley Mead 
      shall remain a riverside pleasance for future Reading, and not suffer from 
      the haphazard and unsightly development which marks the southern riverside 
      between <strong>Caversham Bridge</strong> and <strong>Reading 
      Bridge</strong>         
                  
                   
               
                  
                    
                    
                       
                   
                  
              . </p>
      <p>The fact that Earley Mead is often flooded will be 
      no deterrent to its use when the advice of modern engineers is sought. It 
      may be assumed that as the extension of 1911 expressly excluded most of 
      the <strong>Caversham Park estat</strong>e and placed it in the parish of 
      <strong>Eye and Dunsden</strong>, no attempt will be made to cross the 
      Thames again in order to join up with the present borough boundary at 
      <strong>Emmer Green</strong>. But two facts are pertinent here: one is 
      that the municipal cemetery is at present outside the area of the local 
      authority, and the other that building developments are rapidly proceeding 
      along the <strong>Henley Road</strong> towards <strong>Play Hatch</strong>          
                    
                   
                    
                      
                  
                         
                   
       and in the vicinity of the new burial ground. Before 1887 
      the old Reading cemetery was outside the borough bounds. </p>

      not take this course, but pass by an arbitrary way across the line, 
      and include the whole of the village of Sonning, making the Thames 
      our northern line of demarcation to the Kennet mouth. </p>
      <p>May not Reading then become a great city of the 
      south and the centre of a new <strong>Diocese of Berkshire</strong>, with 
      its stool and <strong>Cathedral Church at Sonning</strong>         
                   
                    
                   
                   
                     
                  
                    
                   
                 
                   
                   
                 
      ? I fear that the answer will be that this is visionary; but such a 
      vision would be but to restore to that 
      Thames-side village some of those ancient ecclesiastical glories that go back into the 
      dim recesses of time, possibly before the Danes came with fire and 
      sword to lay waste the pleasant lands of Berkshire. </p>

      and beauty, may we not say that there is a growing desire to see, and 
      intelligent bodies to ensure, that vandalism shall be 
      stayed and beauty conserved. We led off with a promise of some historic 
      details of the areas included in our perambulation. It is to be

      <p>        
                   
              Britain’s first stream-line rail car will shortly 
      be introduced by the <strong>Great Western Railway</strong> on its 
      suburban services between <strong>Reading and Slough</strong>. It looks 
      more like the giant gondola of an airship than a railway carriage, and it 
      is the outcome of exhaustive tunnel tests to reduce wind resistance, which 
      at speed requires considerable power to overcome. Each compartment is 
      fitted with a clock and speedometer, and a microphone enables the driver 
      to communicate with the guard or passengers. Flush fitting observation 
      windows run        
                   
              along the top part 
      and merge at each end into sloping control cabins. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              The interior is decorated in brown and green. The 
      sides of the car are covered in mottled green rexine, and the roof in 
      cream rexine. The floors are covered with insulboard to deaden noise, and 
      green lino and mottled green carpets. All the woodwork is in walnut. 
      Flush-fitting ceiling lights and lights on the under-side of the luggage 
      racks are provided. The coach is heated by hot water heaters fed from the 
      radiator. There is an        
                   
              emergency lever which stops 
      the engine and applies the brakes when pulled down. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              The car is 62 ft. long and 11 ft. 4 ins. high. It 
      weighs 20 tons, and has been designed for a maximum speed of 60 m.p.h. 
      Seating capacity is for 69 passengers. The car is driven by a 130 h.p. 
      heavy oil engine, using non-inflammable fuel, and this        
                   
              engine is almost identical 
      to those fitted in some of the London ’buses. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              The sides of the car extend to within a foot of 
      the track, so that practically the whole of the vehicle, including wheels, 
      is enclosed in a stream-line case. Everything possible has been enclosed, 
      even to the head and tail        
                   
              lamps, controlled from the 
      driver’s seat, which are fitted flush with the case. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              The effect of this stream-lining has been to        
                   
              reduce wind resistance to 
      one-fifth of that encountered by a similar square-ended car.&nbsp; </p>

              Among the local records which in recent years have 
      been slowly emerging from dusty black tin boxes and similar dark 
      repositories are some maps and deeds relating to the <strong>Liberty of 
      Earley</strong>        
                   
                       
                 
                  and 
      its ancient manors. The present writer has, on more than one occasion, 
      dealt with certain of these records in these columns, but there        
                   
              is still much of 
      local historic interest which will well repay the salving. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              Among the subjects which have not before been 
      touched upon are the ancient Wharf and Ferry, which were situated at the 
      junction of the <strong>Thames</strong> and the <strong>Kennet</strong>        
                   
                      
                   
             where the mighty gas holder now 
      looms like a dark colossus over the landscape. In endeavouring to deal 
      with this area of land it must be remembered that the two embankments of 
      the railways have almost entirely obliterated the original territorial 
      layout; and        
                   
              care needs to be 
      exercised where such a drastic reconstruction has taken place. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              It would be well, perhaps, to deal first with the 
      <strong>Wharf</strong>

      from Caversham Mill to Earley Point (about three-quarters of a mile this side 
      of Sonning Lock) runs in an arc, and within this arc is the Kennet embouchure. 
      The wide circular sweep        
                   
              can best be seen 
      from the high embankment of the Great Western Railway. </p>

              From very early times there existed in the Liberty 
      of Earley six common fields and a common mead, the latter bordering the 
      Thames from a spot just below the present <strong>Dreadnought Inn</strong> 
      to <strong>Earley Point</strong>, where the boundary of the Liberty was 
      situate. These great fields represented, until the enclosures of the 18th 
      and early 19th centuries, the mainstay of economy in the district from 
      long before the Norman invasion. The only one that concerns us in these 
      notes is that called <strong>Wharf Field</strong>        
                   
                        
                  
                    
                   
                   
                   
                    
                  
                
                   
                  
                   
                   
                   
                    
                  
                    
                   
                    , 
      which derived its name        
                   
              apparently from the presence 
      of a wharf at the junction of the rivers. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              Wharf Field was the north-westerly of the six and 
      reached to the angle formed by the Kennet and the Thames. On its western 
      side it touched the boundary of the borough of Reading. The Wharf itself 
      seems to have extended from a site now occupied by an inn called The 
      <strong>Jolly Anglers</strong> on Kennet Side to the site of <strong>The 
      Dreadnought</strong>. The actual point of confluence of the rivers was 
      called the <strong>Mead Marsh</strong>        
                   
                        
                  
                    
                   
                   
                   
                    
                  
                
                   
                  
                   
                   
                   
                    
                  
                    
                   
             ; it was subject to flood, and the 
      Wharf therefore ran across        
                   
              in a north-easterly line 
      rather than a triangular line between its two extremities. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              The origin of the Wharf has never been explained; 
      in fact, few know that it ever existed at this spot, and no records have 
      as yet been found to indicate its purpose or the produce, if any, that was 
      landed there. It is referred to in 1669, upon an old map which is the 
      writer's possession, simply as “The Wharf”, and to the south and east are 
      depicted the numerous “shots” and acres of the Wharf Field. It is 
      significant that upon this map there is indicated a lane running from the 
      present London Road, opposite <strong>The Marquis of Granby</strong>        
                   
                       
                     
                     
                     
                   
                  
                   
                    
                   
              , down to the 
      Kennet, and called “The Lane leading to the Wharf”. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>CARRIAGE OF GOODS ON THE 
      THAMES.</strong>        
                   
                  
               </p>
      <p>        
                   
              It is sometimes forgotten that the carriage of 
      goods on the river Thames is of very early origin. Quite apart from the 
      bulk that could be carried in this way, there were no roads worth the 
      name; the majority of ways were simply miry tracks impassable at certain 
      seasons of the year, and the vehicles were unsuited for anything but 
      personal transportation. Most of the merchandise went by pack-horse. The 
      task of assembling on the spot the mass of material for the erection of 
      such a building as <strong>Reading Abbey</strong> can thus be appreciated, 
      for a considerable amount of the material was non-local. It is obvious, 
      therefore, that <strong><a 
      href="../C19/properties_river_loddon.htm">carriage by water</a>  </strong>        
                   
                      
                    
                    
                  
                  
                
                    
                  
                
           was greater than        
                   
              is popularly supposed. We 
      have a record in this connection which is interesting. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              In the year 1205, <strong>King John</strong>, by 
      letters patent, granted to <strong>William, the son of Andrew</strong>        
                   
                       
                   
                  
                  
                , “our 
      servant”, the right to have one ship going and returning upon the 
      Thames between London and Oxford, with his property and merchandise free and 
      unmolested by any toll and exactions; and he was allowed freely and without hindrance 
      to load that vessel wherever on the Thames he desired between 
      these two cities. What hazards he encountered in his journeys must be left 
      to the imagination; they were        
                   
              many if the state 
      of the river in later centuries is any criterion. </p>
      <p>        
                   
                       
                   
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                    
       In 1350, Parliament passed its first Act against obstruction in 
      the navigable highway of the river, and it may be that river-bound traffic 
      continued henceforward to increase despite        
                   
              the wholesale disregard of 
      the enactment by the fishermen, millers and riparian owners. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              But to return to the Wharf and its origin. Not the 
      least significant fact about it is its early decay. One may assume that, 
      although it is referred to in <strong>1669</strong>        
                   
                         
                   
                   
                
                    
                  
                   
                 
                 
                
                
             , the peak of its 
      importance and usefulness had then passed, for contemporary documents have nothing to remark upon 
      it.        
                   
              It is all very 
      mysterious and may therefore be of very early origin. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              It will be remembered that about thirty-five years 
      ago, when the Great Western Railway was widened, a <strong>Saxon 
      cemetery</strong> was found near the Dreadnought on the piece of land 
      called <strong>"Broken Brow"</strong>        
                   
                         
                   
                   
                
                    
                  
                   
              . The discovery 
      raised some interesting problems, not the least intriguing of which was 
      whether there had been an important settlement at Earley, altogether 
      independent of Reading and Sonning, before the Norman invasion. The 
      question has not yet been thoroughly explored, but it is interesting from 
      the fact that the Wharf might conceivably have had its origin in such a 
      settlement.        
                   
              At the moment it 
      would not be safe to go further than this. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>ABBOT DEMANDS TOLL.</strong>        
                   
                  
               </p>
      <p>        
                   
              There is one other suggestion which has been 
      tendered as to its origin, but in the absence of documentary evidence it 
      must be received with caution. The pre-1887 boundary between Reading and 
      the parish of Sonning (which, of course, included the Liberty of Earley) 
      was not, as one would suppose from the ease of such a natural landmark, 
      the actual point of junction of the two rivers, but        
                   
              the aforesaid lane which 
      terminated some three hundred yards from the river mouth. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              There are still remaining in <strong>Avon 
      Place</strong> the fragments of an old chalk and flint wall which at one 
      time formed the boundary line. The wall ran north and south, and turning 
      east from it are still sections of an old cob wall which ran north-east 
      across to The Dreadnought. This wall appears to mark the landward line of 
      the Wharf. There was probably a good and sufficient reason, in remote 
      times, for the original choice of boundary at this spot, but it is lost in 
      the mist of time. It is notorious that ancient boundaries are sometimes 
      inordinately perverse. Now, slightly to the west of the point at which the 
      boundary strikes the Kennet was anciently <strong>a lock belonging to the 
      Abbot of Reading</strong>        
                   
                      
                    
                    
                   
                  
                   
                     
                
                   
                   
      and called Brokenbrow, or Brokenburgh lock. It is obviously associated 
      with the piece of land upon which the Saxon        
                   
              cemetery was discovered, and 
      the name would seem to be Saxon in origin. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              In the year<strong> 1404</strong> the Abbot 
      bethought him of an additional method of increasing the monastic revenues. 
      Before traders could bring their merchandise by boat up to the common 
      landing place at the High Bridge in Reading, or carry it thence, they were 
      compelled to pay toll to the Abbot for passage through his lock and the 
      waters which ran within the precincts of the Abbey. It is common knowledge 
      that for several centuries the relations between the <strong>Gild Merchant 
      of Reading</strong>        
                   
                        
               
                   
                    
                    
                   
                  
                  
                   
                  
                  
                 
                and the 
      Abbot were not exactly cordial, and the establishment of a wharf just outside 
      the jurisdiction of the Abbot may have been the outcome of a 
      determination of the merchants of Reading to evade the monasterial imposts and, after landing        
                   
              their produce at the 
      Wharf at Earley, convey it overland without further interference. </p>
      <p>        
                   
                        
               
                   
                    
                    
                   
                  
                  
                   
                  
                  
        Similarly as a point of departure for London and 
      Oxford bound traffic the Wharf would have been effectual in evading the 
      abbatial exactions. This, then, may be an other reason for the origin of 
      the Wharf; but, while it is entitled to consideration, undue weight must 
      not be attached to it; there may have been other and more cogent reasons        
                   
              why the Wharf was 
      fixed here, and they may yet come to light. </p>

              There is an old deed in existence which gives some

      service as other        
                   
              the tenants of the 
      said Manor of right ought to do and perform”. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              A word as to the parties in this transaction. Of 
      Owen Haistwell, who may have held part interest in the manor, nothing 
      appears to be known. Richard Manley was an attorney, a member of the 
      Manleys of Cheshire, of long and influential ancestry. He became possessed 
      of Erleigh Court by his marriage with the niece of <strong>Sir Owen 
      Buckingham</strong>, who died in 1713. Richard Manley contested the seat 
      for Reading in 1739, but was defeated by <strong>John Blagrave</strong>        
                   
                        
                  
                   
                 
                   
                   
                     
                  
                    
                   
                   
                    
                   
                  
                 
                 
                    
                  
                   
              
                    
                    
                  by three votes. 
      He died in or about the year 1750. The Sir 
      Edmund Fettiplace referred to was in possession of Erleigh Court prior to        
                   
              1666, about which time 
      it was purchased of him by Sir Owen Buckingham. </p>
      <p><strong>Peter Breach</strong> was a member of an 
      old Sonning family, and it is possible that the lease in 1733 marks their 
      first territorial acquisition in Earley. There are records of them at 
      Sonning as far back as the reign of Elizabeth, when we find that 
      <strong>John Breach and William Breach</strong> were defendants in a 
      Chancery suit where certain persons claimed, in 1585, divers lands in 
      Sonning by descent in coparcenary. In 1721-22, Peter Breach, of Sonning 
      Eye, husbandman, aged 60, deposed that his father occupied an estate of 
      his own in Eye reputed worth about £40. In 1783, there was an<strong> 
      Isaac Breach</strong>        
                   
                        
                  
                   
                 
                   
                   
                     
                  
                    
                   
                   
                    
                   
                  
                 
                 
                    
                  
                   
              
                    
                    
                     
             in occupation of 
      the “bucks” standing below Earley Point, and in 1804 a Peter Breach        
                   
              was having trouble with 
      the Thames Commissioners regarding an encroachment below Caversham Pound. </p>
      <p><strong>Breach's Weir</strong>, which is referred 
      to by <strong>John Taylor</strong>, the water poet, in the 17th century, 
      was near the small islands at <strong>Earley Point</strong>, and for long 
      it was a source of annoyance and danger to all who used the navigable part 
      of the river. Despite repeated injunctions the Breaches clung tenaciously 
      to their weir, but were at length forced to remove it. It should be noted 
      that there are still <strong><a

              To revert to the lease to Peter Breach. It would 
      now be difficult to locate the site of the buildings newly erected in 1733 
      on the land granted to him; but the old inn known as the 
      <strong>Dreadnought</strong> deserves a word or two in this connection 
      since it was the home of the Breach family for many years. A century or so 
      ago it was called<strong> The Broken Brow</strong>        
                   
                        
                    
                    
                     
                     
       – from that persistent place-name we have before encountered – and 
      there is a tradition that long before it was an inn, it was a shooting box 
      for the lord of the manor. The present building is about two hundred years 
      old, and until early Victorian times appears to have been the home of the 
      Breaches, who, in addition to        
                   
              being fishermen, owned reed 
      or withy beds on various parts of the river. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              Old inhabitants of Earley, notably <strong>Mr. 
      George B. Wheeler</strong>        
                   
                      
      , dairyman, of Kennet's Mouth, who has spent his whole life in the 
      district with which these notes are concerned, can recall that The 
      Dreadnought at one time had a skittle alley, but it was burnt out by 
      accident many years ago. There used to be some fine walnut trees on the 
      green beside the inn. It may be possible to learn when, and why, the old 
      inn changed its name to The Dreadnought, a        
                   
              very much less interesting 
      and euphonious sign. It must have been before 1868. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              And now a few words as to the 
      <strong>Ferry</strong>. It is probably not of such ancient usage as the 
      Wharf, but in the thirteenth century it was within easy distance of 
      historic establishments. Facing it on the rising ground of the Chilterns 
      was the castellated home of <strong>William Mareschal, Earl of 
      Pembroke</strong>, that “very perfect knight” who was <strong>Regent of 
      England</strong> during the boyhood of <strong>Henry III</strong>, and who 
      lies buried in the <strong>Temple church, London</strong>; to the 
      south-west loomed the flint and stone mass of <strong>Reading 
      Abbey</strong>; to the east the manor place of the <strong>Bishops of 
      Sarum at Sonning</strong>; and to the south-east, in a belt of forest 
      trees, the more modest steading of the knightly family of the <strong>de 
      Erleghs</strong>        
                   
                         
                   
                 
                   
                  
                    
                  
                    
                    
                    
                  
                  
                    
                  
                      
                   
                 
                  
                      
                  
                    
                   
                   
                  
        .        
                   
              And yet we hear 
      nothing of this river crossing until quite recent times. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              A ferry-boat was first provided in 1810, and the 
      ubiquitous <strong>Peter Breach</strong>, a descendant of the Peter of the 
      coppice, was appointed ferryman at wages of 20s. a month. He was then 
      probably living at The Broken Brow. He was authorised and empowered to 
      collect a toll of 2d. per horse. At the end of 1812 a <strong>James 
      White</strong> took over the duty at&nbsp;15s. a week, but this increase 
      of emoluments appears to have been coupled with additional duties as 
      keeper of <strong>Blake's Lock on the Kennet</strong>, the legitimate 
      successor of <strong>the Abbot's lock</strong>        
                   
                         
                   
                 
                   
                  
                    
                  
                    
                    
                    
                  
                  
                    
                  
                      
                   
                 
                  
                      
                  
                    
                   
                   
                  
                
                   
                  
              . </p>
      <p>        
                   
                         
                   
                 
                   
                  
                    
                  
                    
                    
                    
                  
                  
                    
                  
                      
                   
                 
                  
       In 1823 we learn that the Ferry was operated by a chain. Lying a few 
      yards back from the river is still the small “ferryman's cottage”, which 
      was built in 1843 in place of a former cottage that had become ruinous. 
      Many middle-aged folk can remember the ferry and the pleasant scene of the 
      towing horses being ferried across the river, for it was not until 1892 
      that the present towpath bridge was built and the Great Western Railway 
      bought up the        
                   
              ferry-house and other property 
      at Kennet's Mouth which had belonged to the Conservancy. </p>
      <p>        
                   
              Before leaving the Ferry there is one item of 
      interest that may claim a moment's notice. From very early times a bridle 
      path led across the Earley meadows to Sonning. It still does. It commenced 
      at a spot of late years occupied by <strong>East's boathouse</strong>        
                   
                       
                   
                   
               , and crossed the two 
      railway embankments. Some years ago the entry to the path was diverted to 
      a spot between the two embankments, and only one – the Great Western – had 
      to be crossed. Within the last few years it has been diverted again and 
      now commences actually to the north of the Great Western Railway line and 
      takes a rather undignified course along the northern face of the 
      embankment and by an almost right-angled turn reaches the towpath. One 
      wonders how, in times of high flood, it is possible to reach the entry of 
      the path at the river mouth. In part this ancient route must have been in 
      close contiguity to the Wharf, and served a very useful purpose in 
      mediaeval        
                   
              days before the present 
      London road from Reading to Sonning had been made. </p>
