<p class="stbody">We are grateful to <strong>Chris Humby and the Bishopstoke 
History Society </strong>for their research on <strong>'The Mount' at 
Bishopstoke</strong>, and for uncovering Thomas's rather colourful history away 
from Arborfield. </p>

	  <p class="stbody">In June 1870, a legal agreement (indenture) was 
	  established between <strong>Thomas Hargreaves</strong>, a <strong>
	  Geraldine Bertha Warriner</strong> and a <strong>Dillon Lewis</strong> (a 
	  solicitor?) and contained the following caveat:</p>
	  <p class="stbody">&nbsp;<strong><em>&quot;Out of regard and respect for Mrs. 
	  Geraldine Bertha Warriner, Thomas Hargreaves is desirous of settling 
	  during her life the interests, dividends and annual proceeds arising from 
	  the sum of £6,000 which he has paid to Dillon Lewis as a trustee... </em>
	  </strong> </p>
	  <p class="stbody"><em><strong>&quot;</strong></em><strong><em>After her death 
	  these (monies) are to be paid to T. Hargreaves. She covenants that in 
	  respect of this trust she will not hereafter, in any way, wilfully 
	  interfere or communicate with the said T. Hargreaves.&quot;</em></strong><img alt="" height="400" src="../images/new/The_Mount_2_TN.jpg" style="float: right" width="254"></p>
	  <p class="stbody">Clearly, Thomas wanted to tell the wider world that 
	  whatever had been going on between him and Mrs. Warriner, it was to stop. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">Only one month later, Thomas Hargreaves bought <strong>
	  <a href="properties_The_Mount_Bishopstoke.htm">'The Mount' at Bishopstoke
	  </a></strong>near Southampton. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">According to the advertisement placed in 
	  the local newspaper:</p>
	  <p class="stbody">&nbsp;<i><strong>&quot;The whole property embraces an area of 
	  about 28½ acres, every step through which leads to some fresh point of 
	  beauty, and the 'tout ensemble' is so exquisite that it would, indeed, be 
	  difficult to conceive a more interesting or perfect place. </strong></i> </p>
	  <p class="stbody"><strong><i>&quot;</i></strong><i><strong>The Auctioneers 
	  have, therefore, great pleasure in recommending the property to the 
	  attention of those who desire to obtain an elegant home in the south of 
	  England.&quot; </strong></i> </p>
	  <p class="stbody">However, within a few years it had been remodelled into 
	  an Italianate style, and the house and grounds of <strong>
	  <a href="memories_Thomas_Hargreaves_Mount.htm">'The Mount'</a></strong> 
	  were thrown open for many local events. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="stbody">&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="stbody">It was very convenient for Thomas Hargreaves to 
	  return to Berkshire where he remained a J.P., as shown on the <strong>
	  Cruchley Railway Map of 1863</strong>:</p>
	  <p class="stbody"><a href="../images/new/Cruchley_Rly_Map_1863.jpg">
	  <img alt="" height="538" src="../images/new/Cruchley_Rly_Map_1863_TN.jpg" width="554"></a> </p>
	  <p class="stbody">According to the 1871 Census, the head of the household 
	  at 'The Mount' was <strong>Mrs. Warriner</strong>, living with her two children plus six 
	  servants; in addition, a certain 'Thomas Hargreaves' was listed as a 
	  'Visitor'. This pretence was maintained for a few years until the couple 
	  was accepted by the villagers and gentry alike - <strong>
	  <a href="memories_Thomas_Hargreaves_Mount.htm">especially since The Mount 
	  was made available for so many social events</a></strong>.</p>
	  <p class="stbody">Later newspaper reports would show that the couple remained close 
	  until her death in December 1885. A baby was born in 1871 at Bishopstoke 
	  and was named <strong>Cecil Montague</strong>; when Thomas' Will was 
	  published in 1891, Cecil was identified as his own son.</p>
	  <img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ><br>
	  <br>Capt. Hargreaves inherited a huge fortune on his father John's death, 
	  and spent a fair bit of it on a schooner known as the <strong>
	  <a href="memories_Thomas_Hargreaves_Ianira.htm">'Ianira'</a></strong>, 
	  with a uniformed crew of 12. It was used on extended trips to the 
	  Mediterranean, and like other expensive yachts, it was followed closely by 
	  reports in the local newspaper, the Hampshire Advertiser. <br><br>It was later 
	  given a steam engine to help it to enter and leave port, though for most 
	  of the time it would be powered by sail. <br><br>

</b><img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ><p class="stbody">
	  Capt. Hargreaves was called to appear as a witness in the <strong>
	  <a href="memories_Florence_Arthur_Libel_Case.htm">Florence Arthur Libel 
	  Case</a> </strong>in April 1887, where he effectively admitted that he and 
	  Florence Arthur had been living as man and wife until late 1886.</p>
	  <p class="stbody"><img border="0" alt="" src="../colours/spffcc00.gif" width="100%" height="2" ></p>
	  <p class="stbody">Around 1889, Thomas Hargreaves struck up a friendship 
	  with a young artist, <strong>Julius M Price</strong>, who much later wrote 
	  a book<strong> <a href="memories_Bohemian_Days_in_London.htm">'My Bohemian Days in London</a></strong><a href="memories_Bohemian_Days_in_London.htm">'</a>, where he gave a 
	  vivid and affectionate description of Thomas.</p>
	  <p class="stbody">Even at that time, Captain Hargreaves was not in good 
	  health, and on 28th September<strong><a href="families_Thomas_Hargreaves_postscript.htm"> 
	  he died</a></strong> at the British Hotel in Jermyn Street, London; he was 
	  buried in the family vault in Arborfield, where his long-suffering wife
	  <strong>Sarah</strong> joined him following her death in 1918.</p>
