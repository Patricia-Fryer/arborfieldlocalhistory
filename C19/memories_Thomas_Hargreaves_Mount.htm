	  When at The Mount in 
	  Bishopstoke, <strong>Thomas Hargreaves</strong> was universally addressed as '<strong>Captain Hargreaves'</strong>. Although he gained 
	  the title through his time with the Army, it seems that he was known 
	  locally as a seafarer, so was he pretending that he was a Naval captain?<br>
	  <br>
	  <img alt="" height="292" src="../images/new/LSWR_Servants_Orphanage_fete_ad_HA_18910715.jpg" style="float: right" width="400">Come what may, he threw open 
	  <strong>The Mount</strong> for all manner of social 
	  events and also provided marquees for other events held locally. He also 
	  played his part in helping the community, including putting out a 
	  neigbour's <strong><a href="#HayFire">hay fire</a></strong>, and <strong>
	  <a href="#NarrowEscape">helping victims of a carriage crash</a></strong>. <br><br>The following newspaper reports give a flavour of what went on 
	  at these occasions. <br><br>The first article shows that Mrs. Warriner and Thomas 
	  Hargreaves were not yet treated as a couple, but they soon became accepted 
	  in local society. <br><br>It also appears that members of Captain 
	  Hargreaves' family were present at some of the social occasions, such as 
	  the <strong><a href="#Builders">Portsmouth Builders' Association's big day

	  this society, established in 1871, and the president of which is Mr. 
	  Thomas Chamberlayne (Cranbury Park), was held in the grounds of 
	  Barton-farm, near the Bishopstoke Railway Station, on Wednesday, and 
	  proved to be the most successful exhibition that has been held in 
	  connection with the society, the competition being very close indeed for 
	  the 367 prizes offered for flowers, &amp;c. In the afternoon there were one or 
	  two smart showers, but notwithstanding this the attendance was large, 
	  especially towards the evening, no less than £26 being paid for admission.
	  </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The grounds were decorated 
	  with flags, and the company in the afternoon included the <i>elite</i> of 
	  the neighbourhood, among those present being Captain and Mrs. Crofts, Mr. 
	  A. R. and Mrs. Naghten, Mr. Spencer Smith, Dr. Osborn, Mr. and Mrs.

	  brethren of the two societies attended the Church of Bishopstoke, where a 
	  sermon was preached by the Rev. R. E. Harrison, who took for his text 
	  “They that are whole need not a physician, but those that are sick”. A 
	  collection was made by the express wish of the two societies, in behalf of 
	  the Royal South Hants Infirmary, when £3 17s 6d was collected.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Yesterday (Tuesday) the 
	  members, of “Loyal Noah's Ark” lodge of the Manchester Unity of 
	  Oddfellows, and those of Court “Chamberlayne” Ancient Order of Foresters, 
	  held an amalgamated gala and fete, which passed off with the most 
	  unprecedented success. Forming in procession in the village about 12 
	  o'clock, and after paying a friendly visit to Brother Cheater, of the Home 
	  Tavern, they proceeded to <strong>The Mount, Bishopstoke (which was kindly 
	  thrown open for their use by Mrs. Warriner)</strong>, headed by the fine 
	  band of the 1<sup>st</sup> Hants Engineers, conducted by Mr. J. D. Wilson, 
	  bandmaster. Returning from here the procession wended its way to the 
	  Anchor Inn, Bishopstoke, which is picturesquely situated opposite a broad 
	  bend of the beautiful River Itchen. A most substantial dinner was provided 
	  by host Wilkins, to which from 150 to 160 sat down and did full justice to 
	  it. [...] “The health of the Chairman” concluded the toast list.</p>

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The procession was then 
	  re-formed and marched to The Mount, at which beautiful grounds a great 
	  number of people, wives, children, and friends of the members were 
	  assembled, and these wandered about the grounds, evidently delighted with 
	  the splendid gardens and scenery, or listened to the strains of the 
	  Engineers' band. Towards evening the chief of the committee and a few 
	  others assembled in front of the house, with the band, <strong>and Mrs. 
	  Warriner and Captain Hargreaves received them</strong>. - Mr. Bundy then 
	  returned thanks for the Foresters, Mr. Pope (by request) for the 
	  Oddfellows, and Mr. Bemister for the visitors, for the kindness of the 
	  owner in allowing the use of their grounds. A gracious acknowledgement was 
	  made, accompanied with a present of £1 from Mrs. Warriner and £1 from 
	  Captain Hargreaves, and the band played “Auld Lang Syne”. In the evening 
	  dancing and other amusements were indulged in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	  </a>Hampshire Advertiser, 29th July 1876: BISHOPSTOKE - HAY ON FIRE</strong><br>
	  <br>On Sunday afternoon, between 1 and 2 o'clock, a rick of hay was 
	  discovered to be on fire in a place known as Withy Mead, in the occupation 
	  of Mr. William Jeffery, and about a quarter of a mile from the railway 
	  station.
	  </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Immediately on its being 
	  known the fire engine was got out by the brigade, and proceeded to the 
	  scene of the conflagration, when it was found that two more ricks had 
	  taken fire, and was at that time one mass of flame. There was plenty of 
	  water, and copious streams from the engine, assisted by many willing 
	  helpers with buckets, soon told upon it, and after a few hours the firemen 
	  were enabled to cut the rick in two, and also cut the outsides of others, 
	  thus saving a large quantity of hay.
	  </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Too much priase cannot be 
	  bestowed on the fire brigade, who, under the superintendence of Mr. James 
	  Hunett, exerted themselves manfully. Mr. H. M. Taylor, Mr. Donkin, of 
	  Barton Farm, <strong>Captain Hargreaves</strong>, Mr. H. Williner, jun., 
	  &amp;c., ably assisted. At 10.15 p.m., the brigade left Mr. Pridmore, the 
	  bailiff, and his men in charge for the night, but on Monday night at 11.30 
	  they were again called, for the fire had broken out afresh, but after a 
	  night's work it was extinguished, much extra damage being done.
	  </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Nine and a half minutes only 
	  elapsed from the time of the ringing of the fire bell until the engine was 
	  brought to play upon the fire, thus showing the alacrity displayed by the 
	  brigade. The cause of the fire was the heating of the new hay.</p>

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On Saturday the annual grand

	  the gradual importance and increase which has been apparent for some years 
	  from the exertions of the committee, and, especially, the chairman (Col. 
	  Lacy), the vice-chairman (Mr. Philp), the energetic hon. Secretary (Mr. C. 
	  S. Fuige), and the assistant secretary (Mr. Snelgrove), was exemplified 
	  this year, every branch of the show being, with few exceptions, in 
	  excellence far beyond those of former years. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On Saturday, the weather 
	  being fine, the attendance was much larger than the previous year, which 
	  was then considered very good, even for this, the largest show held in the 
	  Southern District of Hants, if not in the county as a whole. To Mr. Fuidge 
	  and his assistant must be given the credit of staging the plants and 
	  vegetables to the best advantage, for the benefit of the exhibitors and 
	  also the sightseers, and this was a work inculcating no little time and 
	  labour, there being four large marquees, while the cut flowers, fruit, 
	  table decorations, and bouquets, epergnes, &amp;c., the gem of the show, were 
	  exhibited in a magnificent marquee, lent by Capt. Hargreaves, of 
	  Bishopstoke.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The importance of the show, 
	  which is gradually extending its dimensions, may be gathered by a glance 
	  at the prize list, which, offering prizes totally worth £200, brought 
	  competitors not only from those neighbourhood, but from Salisbury, Oxford, 
	  and Kingston, in Surrey. […] <strong>The tent lent by Captain Hargreaves, 
	  as before mentioned, was specially devoted to fruit, and flowers, for 
	  decorative purposes, and the exhibitors deserved the utmost praise for

	  The members, with their wives and friends, to the number of about 140, 
	  left the Portsmouth Town Station by special train at 9.30 a.m. for 
	  Bishopstoke, where they arrived in about half-an-hour. </span></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-gb">The party

	  Marine Band (Gosport), then proceeded to <strong>“The Mount”, the seat of 
	  Captain Hargreaves, and about a mile distant from the station. After 
	  roaming about the beautiful grounds and gardens adjoining the mansion, and 
	  viewing the costly pictures, sculpture, and works of art in the picture 
	  gallery, &amp;c., which were much admired, and which, by the way, is well 
	  worth a journey to Bishopstoke, the party proceeded to a meadow adjoining 
	  the grounds, where dinner was provided by Mr. George Elleridge, of the

	  provided, and the Chairman having proposed the usual loyal toasts, Mr. 
	  Drew Bear (of London) proposed the Association, to which the Vice-Chairman 
	  responded. - <strong>Mr. F. White (St. James-road) then proposed the

	  humorous. - The health of the visitors having been proposed by the 
	  Chairman, and responded to by Mr. A. German, and Mr. C. Gillham having 
	  proposed that of the Chairman, <strong>the majority of the party proceeded 
	  to the mansion, the greater part of which was very generously thrown open 
	  for their inspection. Captain Hargreaves, who seemed to take the greatest 
	  interest in entertaining the party, most kindly explained the history and 
	  other details connected with the numerous and attractive works of art with 
	  which his residence is so well filled.</strong> </span></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-gb">The party 
	  were thus agreeably occupied for a considerable time, and then proceeded 
	  to a spot selected for dancing purposes, which, as a matter of course, was 
	  well patronised. Some availed themselves of a row on the river, and the 
	  remaining members by a game of “Aunt Sally”, and in various other ways 
	  until time for tea, which was served at about six o'clock. Before that 
	  repast was over it commenced to rain rather heavily, which prevented 
	  outdoor amusements for a time. The dancing members of the party were, 
	  however, determined not to be outdone, and after clearing away the 
	  tea-tables from the centre of the marquee, they commenced dancing in right 
	  earnest to the enlivening strains of the band, and with Mr. Cole as M.C., 
	  continued the game until darkness set in, and the signal was given for the 
	  return home. </span></p>

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-gb">A very 
	  narrow escape, from what might have proved a very serious accident, 
	  occurred on Thursday afternoon to Captain Cooper and his family, of 
	  Spring-grove, whilst out riding in their carriage. It appears that on 
	  passing the bridge known as High-Bridge, on the road from Bishopstoke to 
	  Eastleigh, and which is in a very bad condition, being full of holes, the 
	  jolting of the carriage caused the pole to strike one of the horses in the 
	  mouth, when it bolted, commenced kicking, and jumped over the hedge on the 
	  right-hand side of the road. <strong>Fortunately, Captain Hargreaves, of 
	  the Mount, was passing in his carriage, </strong>and, with assistance, 
	  Mrs. Cooper, and child, and servant, were, by the kindness of that 
	  gentleman, removed to his carriage, and conveyed to their residence at 
	  Spring-grove, happily, unhurt, but, of course, much frightened. </span></p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-gb">The 
	  horses and carriage were with some difficulty extricated, thanks to the 
	  timely efforts of the employes of Mr. H. Barney, of the Bishopstoke mills, 
	  and some men in the employ of Mr. Black, of Barton farm. Surely, 
	  considering the great traffic on this road, something should at once be 
	  done to prevent anything of this kind occurring again.</span></p>

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This was

	  in number, drawn by grey horse, to the Royal Pier, to receive the Royal 
	  visitors […]</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At the bottom of the 
	  High-street, where the old Water Gate stood, will be erected a triumphal 
	  arch, by the members of the fire brigades in the town. Between Andrews and 
	  Watts's Parks will be a large handsome arch, consisting of two embattled

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The railway bridge in St.

	  on wooden girders covered with straw, and festooned with red, white, and 
	  blue. On the side which the Royal party will approach the beehive will be 
	  the word “Welcome”, and on either side the Royal arms and the letter “B, 
	  with appropriate flags and banners, surmounted by a flag-staff and the 
	  Royal Standard. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 1<sup>st</sup> Hants

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A grand Jubilee fete was 
	  held on Saturday, in the beautiful grounds of <strong>the Mount, 
	  Bishopstoke</strong>, in aid of the funds of the above deserving

	  the committee by Captain Hargreaves, who has generously done the same on a 
	  previous occasion for the same object, and on Saturday, in addition to 
	  throwing open his beautiful grounds, and the splendid picture gallery he 
	  had the extensive demesne brilliantly illuminated at night on a similarly 
	  extensive scale, as when the Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen was recently 
	  celebrated.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The orphanage, which is 
	  situated just below Clapham, was opened on the 11<sup>th</sup> March, 
	  1886, by Mr. W. Wyndham Portal, deputy-chairman of the Board of Directors 
	  of the London and South-Western Railway Company. A start was made with ten 
	  children, but now there are eighteen in the institution, and it is 
	  proposed to have another election in September. At present only girls are 
	  taken at the Orphanage, but efforts are being made to afford accommodation 
	  for boys. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The different <i>employes</i> 
	  all over the London and South-Western Company's extensive system have 
	  taken up the matter with hearty goodwill, and are doing their best to make 
	  the institution successful, and as useful as possible. The Orphanage is 
	  managed solely by a committee composed of <i>employes</i> of the Company, 
	  and there are sub-committees at different stations, Bishopstoke being 
	  amongst their number, and the fete was arranged by the committee at the 
	  latter place, the railway company kindly allowing a reduction of fare from 
	  different stations to Bishopstoke.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The committee having charge 
	  of the arrangements consisted of Inspectors Pearce, Elliott, and Bennett 
	  (Permanent Way), Messrs. Annett, Evans (Booking Office), H. Franklin 
	  (Goods Department), Hales (Carriage Department), Lofting (Telegraph 
	  Department), Neal (Engineers Department), Willmer, jun., Mr. Spencer 
	  (Secretary of the Orphanage), &amp;c.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Nine Elms Guards brass 
	  band travelled from London, and generously gave their services, as did 
	  also the Salisbury Station band. Both bands under the direction of their 
	  respective bandmasters, Messrs. Boys and Venns, played capital selections 
	  of music during the afternoon and evening. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Some capital sports took 
	  place during the afternoon. An open race of 150 yards was won by Vincent, 
	  of Salisbury, Taylor being second. A race 120 yards for railway porters 
	  was won by Hoadley, and Carter second. A quarter of a mile race was won by 
	  J. Bennett, Vincent being second. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Siamese twin race was 
	  gained by Burt and Barnes, Hoadley and Bennett being second. There were 
	  sack races for men and lads, an egg and spoon race for ladies, and a 
	  hotly-contested tug of war. There was also a rifle shooting competition, 
	  and various other amusements were provided, including shooting galleries, 
	  shooting at a running rabbit, imitation pigeons, and glass bottles. There 
	  was also an automatic weighing machine, which registered a person's weight 
	  by dropping a penny into a box, and the receipts were for the benefit of 
	  the Orphanage.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">During the afternoon the 
	  Eastleigh Glee Union, composed of members of different local choirs, under 
	  the superintendence of Mr. Sims, schoolmaster, sang as follows:- Jubilee 
	  Ode, “Awake, Oh Happy Nation”; glee, “The Forester sounds his cheerful 
	  horn”; “Mark the merry elves”; glee, “Huntsmen's Chorus,” Weber; trio, “A 
	  Little Farm well tilled,” Messrs. Franklin, Brown, and Bustard; glee, “The 
	  Carnovale”; glee, “Oh! Where do Fairies hide their Heads”; glee, “March of 
	  the Men of Harlech”; comic duet, “Upper Ten and Lower Five”; glee, “Oh! 
	  Hush thee my Baby.” Mr. Powell acted as accompanist. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The two bands played for 
	  dancing during the evening. Large numbers availed themselves of the 
	  privilege of inspecting the beautiful works of art in the museum and 
	  picture gallery, and at night the beautiful grounds were most brilliantly 
	  illuminated, the electric light being in various points of 'vantage, while 
	  the many pathways and flower beds were marked out with variegated fairy 
	  lamps, thousands being used for the purpose. Chinese lanterns were also 
	  largely used, and the whole presented a most pleasing and fairy-like 
	  aspect. The flag-staff in the grounds was illuminated in rainbow fashion, 
	  in imitation of a yacht.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Captain Hargreaves 
	  laboured assiduously to make the illuminations a success, and was ably 
	  assisted by Mr. Forty and others</strong>. The Mayor of Southampton 
	  (Alderman Harry Coles), Sheriff E. Brown, Councillors W. G. Lankester, and 
	  J. B. Thomas, and Captain E. Gibbs were invited by Captain Hargreaves to 
	  dine with him, and they were taken round and shown the illuminations, with 
	  regard to which they expressed a vote of thanks to Captain Hargreaves for 
	  the kindness he was always showing in lending his grounds for any 
	  deserving object. - Sheriff Brown seconded the proposition, which was 
	  carried with acclamation. - Captain Hargreaves briefly acknowledged the 
	  compliment. -<strong> The visitors were met at the station, and driven 
	  back in vehicles belonging to Captain Hargreaves</strong>.</p>

	  much appreciated was shown by the large number of people who availed 
	  themselves of the opportunity of viewing the spacious and beautiful 
	  demesne, and the pleasure that was freely expressed must have proved a 
	  source of satisfaction to the gallant captain as he walked about amongst 
	  the visitors. The London and South-Western Railway Company aided the 
	  object in view by running cheap excursion trains. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Lockerley Temperance 
	  Band was in attendance during the afternoon, and played an excellent 
	  selection of music which was thoroughly enjoyed and terpsichorean votaries 
	  tripped gaily on the green on the “light fantastic toe” to the strains of 
	  the band. <strong>The grounds were gaily decorated, the men belonging to 
	  Captain Hargreaves' yacht assisting in this work.</strong> The picture 
	  galleries were a source of attraction as usual, and large crowds passed 
	  through, expressing their admiration at the many beautiful objects on 
	  view.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the evening the grounds 
	  were most brilliantly illuminated with the electric light, variegated 
	  lamps, and Chinese lanterns, <strong>as has been the case on several 
	  recent occasions through the extreme liberality of Captain Hargreaves</strong>, 
	  the sight being one that can only be rarely witnessed. Captain Hargreaves 
	  was most energetic to see that the arrangements were carried out, and the 
	  general superintendence was in the hands of Mr. Forty, who most ably and 
	  zealously discharged his duty. The result of the fête is that the handsome

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All lovers of angling on the 
	  lower Itchen, writes “Piscator” to the Hampshire Chronicle will be pleased 
	  to hear that <strong>Captain Hargreaves, of the Mount, Bishopstoke, is 
	  doing his best to get that portion of the river well-stocked with trout</strong>. 
	  He has this season again laid down fro, 30,000 to 40,000 ova in his 
	  breeding house, which is fitted up with all the modern appliances, and is 
	  under the superintendence of Mr. G. Forty, who, by the way, is becoming a 
	  very good pisiculturalist, considering the short experience he has had. 
	  Last season was the first of his breeding trout at the Mount, but he has 
	  found a useful tutor in Mr. H. Diddams, of Hatfield, who was entrusted 
	  with the building and fitting up of the hatching house.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	  <a href="../images/new/The_Mount_3.jpg">
	  <img alt="" height="258" src="../images/new/The_Mount_3_TN.jpg" style="float: left" width="400"></a><strong>Last season Captain 
	  Hargreaves turned out into the river about 20,000 fry and about 2000 
	  yearlings of the River Lea strain</strong>, which were bred in his 
	  hatchery, and the other day when netting for pike several of them were 
	  caught, varying from five to seven inches in length, and in most splendid 
	  condition, which shows how well the Lea trout are doing in the Itchen. 
	  </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is not the least doubt that a cross between these two different 
	  strains of fish will prove a benefit to the old Itchen, for the Lea trout 
	  are a very fine strain of fish, plenty of them weighing from four to five 
	  lbs. each, and show capital sport when hooked, some of them fighting equal 
	  to a salmon. The cross may also help to retrieve the sport which “Detached 
	  Badger” wrote about so deteriorating in chalk streams. Let us hope that 
	  this will be the case, and that we may live to see the good old Itchen 
	  once more holding its place as regards sport. <strong>Wishing Captain Hargreaves 
	  success in every way in his undertaking</strong>, that he may have another 20,000 
	  to turn into the river this year for the benefit of himself and brother 
	  anglers.</p>

	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For the purposes of aiding

	  most successful demonstration and <i>fete</i> took place on Wednesday 
	  afternoon, <strong>in the beautiful grounds of The Mount, Bishopstoke,

	  belonging to the Eastleigh Brigade is the property of the London and 
	  South-Western Railway Company, and most of the members of the brigade are 
	  in the service of the company. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Seeing how the size of 
	  Eastleigh is increasing, it can hardly be expected that the Railway 
	  Company now should provide entirely for the equipment of the brigade, and 
	  as a demonstration and<i> fete</i> at Southampton recently was so 
	  successful, it was determined to carry out a similar event at the former 
	  place. A committee was formed, with Mr. F. L. Stait acting as hon. sec., 
	  and, through their efforts, everything passed off admirably. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Though the weather was 
	  somewhat threatening, the rain kept off, and there was a large attendance 
	  of spectators, among those present and taking an interest in the 
	  competitions being Captain Hargreaves, Mr. H. Willmer, the Rev. J. P. 
	  Nash, and many others. The beautifully laid out gardens were a source of 
	  attraction to many, and the objects of interest in the picture gallery, to 
	  visit which a small charge was made, were viewed by many, and, as usual, 
	  elicited many expressions of admiration.</p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The fine band of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
	  Volunteer Battalion the Hampshire Regiment added to the pleasure of those 
	  present by playing, in first-class style, under the direction of 
	  Bandmaster J. D. Wilson, a capital selection of music, which was much 
	  appreciated, and in the evening afforded gratification to the devotees of 
	  terpsichore by rendering excellent dance music. Miss Frances Delaval gave 
	  some admirable dramatic recitals in the picture gallery in the evening, 
	  which were much enjoyed. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Eastleigh Fire Brigade 
	  did not take part in the competitions, neither did the brigade of the 1<sup>st</sup> 
	  Hants Artillery Volunteers, though both took part in the procession, the 
	  latter, being under the charge of Sergeant-Major Long, and in addition to 
	  these being a number of other brigades. The engine drills were done on a 
	  new manual engine kindly lent by Messrs. Merryweather and Son, water for 
	  the same being pumped up to a tank from the river by means of the 
	  Eastleigh engine. </p>
	  <p CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Southampton Fire 
	  Brigade, which did not, of course, compete at Southampton on the occasion 
	  of their <i>fete</i>, showed their quality by carrying off every first 
	  prize, one second, and a third, defeating, in some cases by a very narrow 
	  margin of time, the crack brigade from the Anglo-Bavarian Brewery at 
	  Shepton-Mallet, which was so successful at Southampton. […]</p>
