<p class="stbody">&nbsp;</p> 
       
<p align="center"><b><i>DEATH OF MR. J. H. SIMMONDS: BUSINESSMAN AND SPORTSMAN.</i></b></p> 
       
<p><i>One of the county’s best-known personalities, Mr. J. H.

After leaving Oxford, Mr. Simmonds entered the bank of J. and C. Simmonds, which

<p class="stbody">The Obituary from the <b>'Berkshire Chronicle'</b> , on Friday 
6th September, was very detailed:</p> 
       
        <font size="2">
<p align="center"><b><i>Death of Mr. J. H. Simonds – Well-Known Reading Banker</i></b></p>
<p><i>Following a sudden illness, the death occurred in the early hours of 
Thursday morning of Mr. John Hayes Simonds, C. B., at his residence, Newlands, 
Arborfield. Mr. Simonds, who was in his 68<sup>th</sup> year, had seemed in 
perfect health on the previous day when he had attended the South Berks Pony 
Show at Calcot. He was the son of the late John Simonds. </i></p>
<p><i>One of the best-known figures in Reading and the county, Mr. Simonds was a 
director of Barclays Bank, Ltd., of H. and G. Simonds Ltd., and chairman of 
directors of Reading Building Society. He was a Deputy Lieutenant for the county 
and had been a Reading borough magistrate since 1934. In July last year he 
relinquished the position of chairman of the Berkshire Territorial Association, 
which he had held for fourteen years. He had been a member and treasurer of the 
Association for many years. He was also a trustee of Reading Savings Bank. Since 
1929 he had been Reading Borough Treasurer.</i></p>
<p><i>Educated at Wellington College and Magdalen College, Oxford, Mr. Simonds 
took his B.A. in 1900. From Oxford he entered the Reading bank of J. and C. 
Simonds, which had been founded in 1813 by Charles Simonds. He subsequently 
became a partner in the bank, and when it was acquired by Barclays Bank, Ltd., 
in 1913, he became a local director of that company. Later he joined the board 
of directors o Barclays Bank Ltd. His association with H. and G. Simonds as 
director extended for some 20 years.</i></p>
<p><i>It was in 1900 that Mr. Simonds was commissioned into the 1<sup>st</sup> 
Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, subsequently the 4th (T) Battalion. He 
retired in 1911 but later rejoined the 2/4 Battalion in 1914 as Major, and 
served in France. In the last war he served with the Arborfield platoon of the 
Home Guard.</i></p>
<p><i>Mr. Simonds was a man of wide interests and he held office in a number of 
organisations in the locality. He was treasurer of Berkshire County Cricket 
Club, Reading Rowing Club, Berkshire Playing Fields Association, of which he was 
also a member of the executive committee; Berks Miniature Rifle Association, 
Reading Poppy Day collections, the Y.M.C.A. War Service Fund in Berkshire, and 
many other bodies. Among other organisations with which been officially 
associated were the Wokingham Club, Reading and District Fat Stock Society and 
Arborfield Cricket Club. He was hon. treasurer of the local fund for the Royal 
Show at Reading in 1926. Mr. Simonds was actively involved with the Savings 
drive during the war and was chairman of the committee of Reading Warships Week 
and chairman of the Bonds Committee of the Salute the Soldier campaign locally.</i></p>
<p><i>Although interested in all sports, Mr. Simonds had closest associations 
with hunting. He had been a member of the Garth almost all his life, and had 
been treasurer since the death of his father in 1929. In his younger days he had 
been a useful rugby player and had appeared for Berkshire Wanderers on frequent 
occasions after leaving Oxford. </i></p>
<p><i>In 1911, Mr. Simonds married Miss Aline Rhoda Sturges, daughter of Mr. 
Edward Murray Sturges, of Barkham. The sympathy of their many friends will go 
out to Mrs. Simonds and the son and two daughters – Major J. A. H. Simonds, Mrs. 
Walker and Mrs. J. F. Hart.</i></p>
<p><i>The funeral will take place on Saturday at 3 p.m.</i></p>

  <p>The Leader column in the <b>'Reading Mercury'</b> on 14th September was 
  entitled: </p>
<p align="center"><b><i>‘The Simonds Family and Newlands’</i></b></p>
<p><i>The death of Mr. J. H. Simonds of Newlands, Arborfield, will be deeply 
regretted by a wide circle of friends. Newlands has long been in possession of 
the Simonds family, and some of their memorials may be seen in the churchyard of 
the old ruined church of St. Bartholomew’s at Arborfield. </i></p>
<p><i>The Liberty of Newland was once part of the Manor of Sonning and was 
included in the Bishop’s Bear Wood. The eastern part remained open and 
unenclosed until 1814. About 1830, John Walter, of The Times, purchased from the 
Crown a large portion of this land for the laying-out of his park and the 
erection of his house. The remaining portion has for many years been held by the 
Simonds family, who, under the Enclosure Act of 1814, added considerably to 
their estate. </i></p>
<p><i>In ancient deeds, Newland is mentioned in a variety of forms: thus, in 
1230 it is "Nova terra"; a century later it is "Nywelond"; and in the middle of 
the 15<sup>th</sup> Century it is "Newelonde".</i></p>
<p>When the 'Reading Mercury' of 28th September reported that a new Reading Borough 
Treasurer was appointed, it recorded that tributes were paid to his predecessor, J. H. 
Simonds.</p>
<p>The following week, 5th October, the 'Reading Mercury' reported on the 
Wokingham Rural District Council, mentioning that Major M. Simonds was appointed 
treasurer to the Council in succession to the late Mr. J. H. Simonds.</p>
<p>Life went on for the grieving family. That same week, on 4th October, the 
'Reading Standard' carried a photo of the Wokingham &amp; District Agricultural Show 
held on Saturday 28th September. The photo caption read: <i>'The President, 
Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Sturges presents a rosette to his sister, Mrs John 
Simonds (on horseback)'.</i> The show was at Woodcray Manor Farm, Finchampstead 
Road. Also, the 'Reading Mercury' of 5th October carried photos of the event, 
including one captiooned: <i>'Mrs Simonds presenting the cup for the best 
turned-out team at the ploughing match to Mr. W. H. Woolford'.</i> </p>
