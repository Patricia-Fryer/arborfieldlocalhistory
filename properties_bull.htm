        “The Bull” inn on the Swallowfield Road is a Grade 11 listed building 
        which is thought to date from the early 17th century.</p>

        <p class="stbody">We learn from an old deed that it was most certainly 
        there in 1707, and there is also a mention in the Church Rate book of 
        1750 - “The Bull Alehouse rated at 4d. to Mr. May”.</p>

        have recently been given an image of what seems to be a Victorian

        more detail.</p>

        In 1839 The Bull Inn was owned by Messrs. Willats 
        Blandy and the land alongside (known as The Orchard), now the copse, by 
        <b>Messrs. J. &amp; C. Simonds</b> who also occupied it.<br>

        Stories &amp; Customs of the Parish of Arborfield and Liberty of Newland” 
        has the following to say:</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><i>“This inn (The Bull) is celebrated as being one of the 
        places where Queen</i></b><b><i> Victoria stopped to bait her horses, as she drove 
        from Windsor to Stratfield Saye to pay a visit to t</i></b><b><i>he Duke 
        of Wellington. Outside the Inn, and across the road, a triumphal arch 
        was built to welcome her. Mrs. Stone told how Sir John Conroy of 
        Arborfield House threatened instant dismissal to</i></b><b><i> any of 
        his employees if they went to the village to see Her Majesty go through. 
        But old John Stone, he did not mind what Sir John said, but put on his 
        best clothes and went. No notice was taken and he remained in the 
        service of the Conroy’s and Hargreaves till he died well over 80.” </i></b></p>

        <p class="stbody">This land is named in the Newlands Estate Sale 
        Documents of 1947 as being for sale by The Simonds Family. It was at the 
        time let to <b><a href="WW1/families_bushell.htm">Mr. Bushell</a></b>, presumably “Jugger”, on a yearly tenancy of 
        £2.10s.0d., although it is believed that his daughter, <b>Lilian Hall</b> ran 
        the pub during the war, he was clearly still connected with it in 1947. 
        He died in <b>1950</b>.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In September 1948 the copse alongside The Bull was 
        sold by <b>John Silvester Gardner</b> to H &amp; G Simonds Limited.</p>

        <p class="stbody">“The Bull” public house has had various owners including H. G. Simonds 
        Brewery, Courage, Barclay and Simonds, and later Courage Brewery. In 
        1999 a transfer of The Bull was made between Inntrepreneur Pub Company 
        Limited and Unique Pub Properties Limited, and the pub was rebuilt in 
        2007 by Enterprise Inns plc.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Here's a view of the Bull taken in 1972:</p>

        <p class="stbody">Sadly, the stable building alongside it on the 
        Swallowfield Road had deteriorated badly by 2004, when it was 
        partly blown down in a gale, as shown below. It was declared unsafe and was 
        demolished by Wokingham District Council, with a promise from the owners 
        that it would later be rebuilt. Happily, that did happen. As of  
        2007, the pub has been renovated and a restaurant has been added. <b>
