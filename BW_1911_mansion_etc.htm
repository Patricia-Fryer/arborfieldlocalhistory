<p class="stbody">The Auction Sale document of <b>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">the</span> Bearwood Estate</b> dating from July 
12th 1911 has been reproduced as a facsimile by the staff of Bearwood College, 
and has many photographs of the mansion and its grounds. </p>
	  <p class="stbody">The Estate was 
described in the facsimile document as:</p>
       
<p class="stbody"><i>The renowned Freehold County Seat distinguished as "Bear 
Wood" comprising a Commodious and Stately Mansion, occupying a Commanding 
Position in a grandly timbered and undulating park, diversified by wonderfully 
beautiful Lakes, the entire Estate extending to over 3,000 acres, and including 
extensive wood and forest lands, seven excellent Farms with superior Residences, 
the picturesque model village of Sindlesham, numerous Small Holdings, Cottages, 
etc.</i></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">There were <strong>five Lots</strong>:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Lot 1:</b> The Mansion and Grounds, occupying "one of the most 
delightful situations in the Home Counties, in the centre of a very favourable 
social district, with excellent sporting amenities". The Sale document quoted 
Kelly's Berkshire Directory as follows:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>Bear Wood was formerly an outlying part of Windsor Forest, 
and still retains much of its primitive wildness of character. Its name is 
supposed to be derived from the Saxon word 'Bere', signifying a farmstead in a 
wood. Hollies and junipers flourish here in great perfection, and the gardens 
abound with rhododendrons and other exotic plants. Most varieties of the fir 
tribe, including a large number of Cedus Deodara are to be found here; but the 
chief attraction is its magnificent lake, which covers a space of about 43 
acres, and contains several islands, one of which is over an acre in extent. 
This fine sheet of water yields to none in the county but Virginia Water in 
point of size, and perhaps not even to that in beauty; the upper lake covers 
over three acres.</i></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Among the delights listed were:</p> 
       
<ul>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody">12 County Seats (including Windsor Castle) within an easy 
drive. </p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody">Hunting with the Garth and the South Berks Foxhounds; also 
with the Berks and Bucks Farmers' Staghounds.</p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody">Golf Links and Polo Ground near (note that the current grounds 
now have two golf courses!).</p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody">Shooting: The woods and plantations, which are well placed, 
extend to about 1,000 acres, and will hold a large head of pheasants, whilst a 
really good bag of partridges, hares, and rabbits can be obtained, as well as 
wild duck.</p>
  <li> 
       
<p class="stbody">Fishing and Boating can be enjoyed on the beautiful lake of 
some 43 acres, besides the lesser lakes.</p> 
       
  </li>
</ul>
       
<p class="stbody">The Mansion was erected some 45 years before, on the site of 
an old residence, in Tudor style of red brick with Mansfield stone dressings, 
and was approached by five principal carriage drives, each guarded by an 
entrance lodge. It had 50 to 60 bed, dressing and bath rooms, 'splendid' suites 
of Reception Rooms, together with a full complement of Domestic Offices.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">On the Ground Floor were listed:</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>A massive and finely carved Stone Porte Cochere, leading by 
a pair of heavy carved oak door to the Vestibule, having tiled floor, wainscot 
oak dado, and painted ceiling, and communicating with the Entrance Hall, with 
oak parquetry floor, panelled oak dado and ribbed ceiling, plus a large Cloak 
Room having fireplace, panelled oak dado, two fitted lavatory basins, two W.C.'s, 
and large store cupboard.&nbsp; A handsomely finely-carved oak and glazed screen 
divides the entrance Hall from the imposing Inner Hall around 30 ft square. </i></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>The Inner Hall has a polished oak floor, with parquetry 
border and open tiled fireplace. The dado, door frames and cornice are of 
panelled and carved oak, the walls being hung with fine old Cordova leather, and 
the ceiling cross-ribbed in oak with carved pendatives. This hall, which gives 
access to the picture saloon and to the circular iron staircase, also opens on 
to the well-lighted Staircase Hall, decorated and fitted with oak in character, 
and from which ascends by easy rise teh Grand Oak Staircase, with panelled 
soffites and carved newels and banisters, illuminated on two sides by leaded 
glass windows, and reaching to the Golden Gallery with beautifully enriched and 
decorated ceiling.</i></p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><i>The well-placed Picture Saloon, which is about 68 ft. 6 in. 
long by about 24 ft. wide, having polished oak floor, with parquetry border, 
with panelled and ebonized walnut dado. Two open tiled fireplaces with tiled 
hearths and massive marble mantelpieces. The oak doors are inlaid with maple and 
walnut. The carved cornice is heavily enriched, and the lighting is by a ceiling 
of ground glass with gilt ornamentation. Adjoining is the Stately Drawing Room.</i></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Other adjoining rooms <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">listed 
were the smaller Drawing Room, Library, Garden Saloon, 'capital' Billiard Room, 
'cheerful' Dining Room with serving lobby, plus Business or Writing Room, Garden 
Lobby, Tea or Morning Room, and Domestic Offices. </span></b>Outside were Model

<p class="stbody">Within<b> <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">the 'Beautiful 
Pleasure Grounds' were <i>extensive Croquet and Tennis Lawns, sequestered 
Woodland and Shrubbery Walks, a Romantic Rock and Water Garden, magnificent 
groups of evergreen and choice-flowering shrubs and Kalmia, which are said to be 
unequalled in the whole country. The double flight of wide steps lead from the 
lower to the upper terrace are a fine achievement in Stone. At the East End the 
charming Rose Garden merges almost imperceptibly into the Pinetum.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b></p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Situated well away from the mansion and pleasure gardens were:</p>

	  <img height="400" src="images/Bearwood/Bearwood_Auction_cover_July_1911.JPG" style="float: right" width="264"></a>Wednesday next, July 12th, is the date fixed for 
	  the Auction Sale of the beautiful “Bear Wood Estate”, which occupies such 
	  an exceptionally commanding and unique situation about 2½ miles from 
	  Wokingham, and adjacent to the picturesque villages of Arborfield and 
	  Barkham and Sindlesham. This renowned Freehold Country Estate comprises a 
	  stately mansion, a grandly timbered park, with extensive lakes, and 
	  exceptionally lovely rhododendron walks and drives, together with 
	  extensive pleasure grounds and gardens; also seven excellent Farms with 
	  suitable residences, and the whole of the model village of Sindlesham, 
	  which is only about four miles from the county town of Reading.<br><br>
	  This lovely Estate is to be offered by Auction in consequence of the 
	  lamented death of <strong><a href="C20/families_arthur_walter.htm">Mr. 
	  Arthur Fraser Walter</a></strong>, son of the late <strong>
	  <a href="families_john_walter_3.htm">Mr. John Walter</a></strong>, who for 
	  many years represented Berkshire in Parliament, and was also the chief 
	  proprietor and controller of the Times newspaper until his death, which 
	  occurred on November 3rd, 1894.<br><br>Messrs. Trollope and Son, the 
	  well-known auctioneers and estate agents, of Mount-street, 
	  Grosvenor-square, W., and 5, Victoria-street, Westminster, have been 
	  entrusted with the auction sale of this important property. The Solicitors 
	  to the Estate are Messrs. Cooke, Cooper and Barry, of Wokingham, and 
	  Messrs. Soames, Edwards and Jones, Norfolk-street, Strand.<br><br>“Bear 
	  Wood” was formerly an outlying portion of Windsor Forest and still retains 
	  much of its primitive wildness of character. Its name is supposed to be 
	  derived from the Saxon word “Bere”, signifying a farmstead in a wood.<br>
	  <br><strong><a href="families_john_walter_2.htm">Mr. John Walter</a></strong>, 
	  the grandfather of the late owner, purchased “Bear Wood” from the Crown 
	  about the beginning of the last century and erected for himself a house of 
	  moderate size in the Wyatt style of architecture. As time went on many 
	  additions to the Estate were made, and adjacent properties in the parishes 
	  of Finchampstead, Arborfield, Barkham, Winnersh, Wokingham, and Sandhurst 
	  were purchased, until the Bear Wood Estate comprised some 5,000 or more 
	  acres. <br><br><strong><a href="BW_1911_outlying_portions.htm">The 
	  outlying portion of this fine property</a></strong>, comprising some 3,000 
	  acres, were offered by auction in March last at the Drill Hall, Wokingham, 
	  and a considerable area was then sold. Now the <strong>home portion of the 
	  Estate</strong>, including the <strong>Mansion and Park and Home Farm</strong> 
	  and <strong>those portions of the property immediately adjacent to “Bear 
	  Wood” itself</strong>, together with the <strong>whole village of 
	  Sindlesham</strong>, will be offered by Auction at The Mart, 
	  Tokenhouse-yard, on Wednesday next, and the sale naturally arouses much 
	  interest amongst adjacent landowners, the tenants and all concerned.
	  <strong>It is also attracting the attention of wealthy Americans and 
	  others possessed of sufficiently ample fortunes</strong> who are seeking 
	  an ideal and imposing residence and an estate which has exceptional 
	  attractions and beautiful surroundings.<br><br>The mansion itself is a 
	  very stately and well-designed erection, containing spacious and handsome 
	  suite of reception rooms, lofty hall, picture gallery, some 50 to 60 
	  bedrooms and dressing-rooms, and all the domestic accommodation and 
	  arrangements which can possibly be required by a family of opulence and 
	  distinction. Indeed, it is well adapted for a royal residence, and <strong>
	  it has been rumoured that it may possibly in the future become a royal 
	  residence for one of our Princes</strong>, for which its situation is so 
	  particularly well suited, being close to Windsor, and even within the 
	  range of Old Windsor Forest itself.<br><br>The present <strong>Mansion</strong> 
	  was erected by the late Mr. John Walter during the years 1865-1869 – and 
	  occupied four years in building. It is a stately edifice of red brick, 
	  with dressings of Mansfield stone in the Tudor style of architecture, 
	  exceptionally well situated on high ground and surrounded by its beautiful 
	  pleasure grounds and a gloriously wooded Park of 500 acres, through which 
	  it is approached by five principal avenue carriage drives, each with its 
	  picturesque entrance lodge. The views from the windows of the mansion 
	  across the grounds and towards the magnificent lake are of exceptional 
	  beauty. <br><br>The <strong>Pleasure Grounds</strong> comprise exquisite 
	  rose garden, upper and lower terrace walks reached by a noble flight of 
	  stone steps, a romantic sunken rock and water garden, with its pools, rare 
	  aquatic plants and ferns, and clumps of bamboos, and shaded by masses of 
	  early flowering rhododendrons, spacious lawns, &amp;c., the whole adorned by 
	  many magnificent specimens of ornamental and forest timber. <strong>Across 
	  the lake are the extensive kitchen gardens, with their many ranges of hot 
	  houses, gardeners' residence and cottages, the poultry farm, the model 
	  laundry, the estate workshops and gas-generating plant, &amp;c.</strong> The 
	  stabling is remarkably complete and well equipped.<br><br>With the Bear 
	  Wood Park will also be offered <strong>“the Home Farm”</strong> of 1<a href="images/Bearwood/BW_1911_northern.JPG"><img class="auto-style7" height="278" src="images/Bearwood/BW_1911_northern_TN.JPG" style="float: right" width="300"></a>75

	  <p class="auto-style3">Unfortunately, despite the puffery in the preview 
	  article, <strong>no Princes or rich Americans put in sufficient bids,</strong> 
	  as an article two weeks later on July 22nd demonstrated:</p>
	  <p class="auto-style4"><strong>LAST WEEK'S AUCTION.</strong></p>
	  <p class="auto-style3"><br>As mentioned in the “Mercury” of last week [<em>there 
	  was actually no mention in the July 15th edition</em>], the <strong>Bear 
	  Wood Estate</strong> of 3,000 acres and the<strong> Tylney Hall Estate 
	  near Winchfield</strong>, with 2,500 acres, were offered by auction on the 
	  12th inst. at the Mart, London, but neither was sold as there was 
	  practically no bidding for either property. </p>
	  <p class="auto-style3">For the Bear Wood Estate the suggested reserve was 
	  mentioned as about £150,000, independent of the value of the timber on the 
	  estate. Upon the Tylney Hall Estate a lavish expenditure had been made by 
	  the owner, who has now returned to South Africa, so that it could not be 
	  parted with under about £200,000, which was understood to be the reserve 
	  price for the property.<br><br>With reference to last week's auction the
	  <strong>“Estates Gazette” of last Saturday</strong> says: <em>“It is not 
	  often that two of the finest estates in England, but unquestionably of the 
	  first rank, each having been the subject of lavish expenditure, are 
	  offered one after another, as was the case on Wednesday by Mr. Henry C. 
	  Trollope (Messrs. Trollope, of Mount-street, Grosvenor-square). The 
	  assembly was one of the most influential seen at The Mart for years, as 
	  the values, at a modest computation, represented a quarter of a million”</em>.
	  <br><br>Foremost, as it certainly takes its place as one of the “stately 
	  homes of England”, and has been famous for one hundred years as the home 
	  of the Walters of “The Times”, came <strong>Bear Wood, in Old Windsor 
	  Forest, at Wokingham</strong>, a magnificent Tudor mansion and 
	  distinguished county seat, with 3,013 acres, having the <strong>model 
	  village of Sindlesham (with church, rectory, institute and cricket field)</strong> 
	  at its gates. </p>
	  <p class="auto-style3">Some lovely vistas are obtained at various points 
	  of the estate, and one great attraction of the stately seat is the 
	  magnificent island-studded lake of forty-three acres, second only to 
	  Virginia Water, whilst parklands, combining cultivation with natural 
	  wildness, exquisite rose gardens, upper and lower terrace walks, sunken 
	  rock gardens, spacious lawns and lofty trees are features. <br><br>
	  Altogether the estate is of quite an exceptional and fascinating character 
	  and is one conferring distinction, position and prestige upon an owner. 
	  The circumstances under which Bear Wood came into the market are 
	  well-known, and Mr. Trollope gave expression to everyone's views in 
	  sincerely hoping that Bear Wood would pass into the hands of one who could 
	  maintain it in the liberal, not to say princely, way it had been conserved 
	  for years past. Properties of that kind were the backbone and pride of the 
	  country, which must continue to exist and flourish, but everybody with 
	  common-sense and foresight must lament that unfair burdens should fall 
	  upon this class of property, which already bears far more than its fair 
	  share.<br><br>Mr. Trollope aptly summed up the advantages of the property: 
	  within 45 minutes by rail of the metropolis, the commercial and 
	  agricultural values, the improved conditions of which must tend to 
	  increase the value of such a property, in addition to the residential 
	  qualifications. Hundreds of thousands of pounds had been spent on the 
	  model village, and the estate, and as an investment the purchase should 
	  prove remunerative, the rent roll amounting to £5,614 per annum, yet £50 
	  an acre, which was merely the mercantile figure, stripped of all 
	  sentiment, was not advanced, nor even £120,000, and <strong>the property 
	  had to be withdrawn</strong>.<br><br>Of the <strong>Tylney Hall Estate</strong>, 
	  the “Estates Gazette” says: A value of £300,000 might fairly be assumed 
	  for such an estate of considerable interest and importance as Tylney Hall, 
	  Rotherwick, Hants, with 2,497 acres, yet this sum was only one-half of its 
	  real worth. It was once the seat of a family of its own name, and 
	  ultimately it came into the possession of <strong>Viscount Castlemaine, of 
	  Ireland</strong>, who was created Earl Tilney in 1732. The owner of Tylney 
	  Hall has the perpetual right of nominating to the Tylney Exhibition of £40 
	  a year at Queen's College, Oxford. This right was included in the sale.
	  <br><br>The mansion, which forms three sides of a square, is in the Tudor 
	  style, was considerably enlarged in 1903. The views are very beautiful 
	  over broken and richly-wooded grounds and valleys. It is a perfect county 
	  seat on a large scale, singularly well-equipped, and perhaps the finest 
	  estate in the market at the present time. Everything about the mansion and 
	  grounds had been arranged with perfect taste, wide knowledge and vast 
	  care, and the purchaser would gain the benefit of the great expense.<br>
	  <br>Mr. Trollope then asked for biddings to start with, but <strong>no 
	  advance even on £200,000 could be obtained, and Tylney Hall had to be 
	  withdrawn for private treaty</strong>.<br></p>
