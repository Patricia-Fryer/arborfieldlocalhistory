        <p class="stbody">There are three known newspaper articles on fires at 
        Arborfield Mill. This is from the 'Reading Mercury' on 29th June 1829, 
        and puts a different slant on the story, concentrating on the plight of 
        the Pither family, and quoting a different date.</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b><font size="4">Calamity by fire. </font></b> </p>

        <p class="stbody">On the night of the 18th of June inst the Corn-Mill in 
        the occupation of <b>Mr. John Pither</b>, at Arborfield, on the Loddon, 
        was burnt to the ground. The fire broke out in an adjoining paper-mill, 
        and had reached to such a height before it was discovered, that all 
        attempts to master the flames proved ineffectual; so that the 
        mill-buildings, with their valuable contents, were utterly destroyed by 
        the hurried efforts made to preserve it; and all the little property of 
        this unhappy family, the necessaries which support, and the comforts 
        which sweeten life, spoilt, wasted, or plundered in the dreadful 
        confusion of the night. </p>

        <p class="stbody">The loss is estimated at £500 - their all! Nothing was 
        insured, so that the ruin is total! And to this destruction must be 
        added the loss of time and of custom, until the mill be rebuilt, and the 
        means of labor, the power of supporting their six young children, 
        restored to the worthy industrious miller and his admirable wife. Under 
        these circumstances, Mr. Pither’s friends are induced to appeal to the 
        charity of the neighbourhood for such assistance, as each, according to 
        his several means, may be enabled to afford.<br>
        <br>
        They are emboldened to this measure by the grievous nature of the 
        calamity, and still more by the exemplary character of the sufferers; 
        who, upright, frugal, and kind, have long been noted for examples - of 
        cheerful industry, and humble benevolence. It is earnestly hoped, that 
        the advantage of such a character may be proved to them in this hour of 
        trial; and that they, who to the utmost of their small power relieved 
        the distressed, and comforted the afflicted, may find a fitting reward 
        in the timely donations and the generous sympathy of their neighbours 
        and of the public. </p>

        <p class="stbody">References as to the facts and the case and the 
        characters of the parties, may be made to the Clergyman of the parish, 
        the <b>Rev. H. Hodgkinson</b>, and to <b>John and Charles Simonds</b>, 
        esqrs, the former of Newlands, the latter of Sindlesham, in the 
        immediate neighbourhood of the scene of the calamity. </p>

        <p class="stbody">Subscriptions will be thankfully received at the Bank 
        of the above John and Chas. Simonds, esqrs, at Reading; and Messrs. 
        Harris and Co., Reading.”<br>
