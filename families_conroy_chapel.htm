<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">– edited by <b>Rev. Peter Ditchfield</b> 
in his regular weekly column in the Reading Mercury, 29th February 1930. Peter 
was the Rector of Barkham for over four decades, and involved with Arborfield 
for many years because of his link with the joint <b>Arborfield, Newland and 
Barkham C. E. School</b>. By this time, Peter Ditchfield was suffering illness, and 
died in September 1930. <b>Mr. Chambers</b> also produced an article on the 
monumental inscriptions on the walls of the old church (which were later 
transferred to the walls of the new church), plus a list of all the inscriptions 
in both the <b><a href="church_old_monuments.htm">old churchyard</a></b> and the
<b><a href="church_new_monuments.htm">new churchyard</a></b>.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The old parish Church, which is close to 
Arborfield Hall, is mainly in ruins (though the north aisle was rebuilt by <b>
Sir Edward Conroy, Baronet, in 1867</b>) and was taken down in 1869. It is much 
to be regretted that the graveyard, which contains the ruins of the old parish 
church where our forefathers worshipped God for so many centuries, is allowed to 
remain in such a neglected state. Will not someone help to restore God’s acre to 
its former beauty?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">1&nbsp; on South Wall</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Over the doorway is an oblong stone 
tablet alluding to the restoration of the north aisle, worded as follows:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This part of the freehold aisle formerly 
attached to the old church of Arborfield (and which was finally taken down 
February 1869) was rebuilt (and enlarged by proper authority) by <b>Sir Edward 
Conroy, Baronet</b>, not only to preserve the tablets and records of his family 
but also as a tribute of love and respect for the memories of his nearest 
relations who were the only members for centuries buried out of Ireland.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">2&nbsp; on North Wall</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">About the centre is a light 
stone-covered carved coat of arms in a shallow recess; below it a marble tablet 
with a light grey background.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sacred to the memory of <b>Sir Edward 
Conroy</b>, of Llanbrynmair, Co. Montgomery, and of Kiltrustan, Co. Roscommon, 
Ireland, Baronet. He was the eldest son of <b>Sir John Conroy</b>, Knight and 
Baronet, and the lineal representative of the chiefs of the native Irish Sept of 
o’Maolconroy, Co. Roscommon, in the Province of Connaught. He was born in 
Dublin, 6 December, 1809. He married in July, 1837, at Kensington, Middlesex, 
the <b>Right Honourable Lady Alicia Parsons</b>, Daughter of <b>Laurence, Earl 
of Rosse</b>, and by her had issue an only son, <b>John Conroy</b>, born 16 
August 1845. He died at his own house at Arborfield on the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
November 1869, and is interred in the family vault.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On East Wall</span></p>

arms in a shallow recess; below it are seven white marble tablets with black
