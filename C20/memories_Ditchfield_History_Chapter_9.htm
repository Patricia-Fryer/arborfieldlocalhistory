<p><b>IX -<font size="3"> </font><font size="2">Swallowfield, Eversley and 
Kingsley's Country</font></b></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">SWALLOWFIELD is a very famous village, mainly on account 
  of the story of the large house, the home of the Russells, which has played no 
  small part in English history. It has an interesting church, built mainly by 
  <b>Sir John Le Despencer</b>, lord of Swallowfield, in 1256, who petitioned the Pope, 
  Alexander IV to allow him to do so, pleading the dangers which he and his 
  family had to encounter in going through the forest to mass at Sonning, from 
  robbers in summer and floods in winter. Two Papal bulls are still in existence 
  sent from Anagni granting this petition.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">The church has a grand timber 
belfry supported by massive beams, such as were not unusual in our Forest 
district when timber was plentiful. The porch is a modern imitation of fifteenth 
century construction, and there were two altars, one at the east end and the 
other in front of the screen as indicated by an ancient piscina. Under the west 
window is a stone coffin containing the remains of the founder.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like many other churches in the middle of the last century 
this one was doomed to destruction. It had been so disfigured by lath and 
plaster, and its many beauties so hidden by tasteless restoration, that it 
seemed as if nothing could make it a worthy and reverent building. It was, 
however, saved by <b>Charles Kingsley</b> who detected its hidden merits and persuaded 
Sir Charles Russell to restore it rather than to pull it down.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">The village takes its name 
from the bird which Lord Tennyson described as "Nature's licensed vagabond", the 
swallow, and appears in old documents as Swalfeld, Swalefeld, Solafel and other 
forms. The drive from the gatehouse next to the village leads across the 
Blackwater river over which one of the owners of the estate, Governor Pitt, 
erected a beautiful bridge with five arches. On the top of the parapet he placed 
a sundial with his initials "T. P. 1722." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Soon the house appears in 
view. It is a large quadrangular house and encloses an inner court which was 
formerly a complete cloister. Two sides of the quadrangle are much older than 
the rest of the house, the roof of these wings being screened with a parapet of 
baluster; one is surmounted by a belfry and the others by a clock-tower.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When Sir Henry Russell bought Swallowfield in 1820 many 
alterations were made and some distressing vandalism was perpetrated. But I must 
say something about the successive owners of tire place. Fuller quaintly 
observes that " the lands of Berkshire are very skittish, and often cast their 
riders, which yet I impute not so much to the unruliness of the Beasts as to the 
unskilfulness of the Riders. I desire heartily that hereafter the Berkshire 
gentry may be settled in their saddles, so that the sweet places in this county 
may not be subject to so many mutations." Swallowfield has certainly been no 
exception to this proverbial skittishness, and has had many owners from the time 
of Edward the Confessor to modern days. Those who would follow all these 
mutations cannot do better than to read Russell's admirable work on <b>"Swallowfield 
and its owners"</b>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Its fascinating pages record 
all that concerns the old house and the many families who have held it. I cannot 
do more than mention a few of the illustrious personages who have been connected 
with it, from the time of Sexi, the Huscarle of the Confessor King to Lady 
Russell and her son Sir Charles, who now holds it. Sexi and other Saxon thanes 
were loyal to King Harold, and were dispossessed at the Conquest, and 
Swallowfield was granted to the Conqueror's "dapifer" or steward, greatest 
friend and councillor, William Fitz Osbern. Amongst other owners have been the 
St. Johns of Stanton, the Despencers, Thomas de Colney. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">The park was used by Edward 
III for the breeding of horses. A large stud was kept there and vast sums spent 
upon their upkeep. He gave as much as a sum equivalent to £2,000 at the present 
time for a grey horse named "Pomers", and "Bayard", a bright brown bay, cost him 
about half that amount. The Earl of Warwick held the manor in chief. It became 
the <b>dowry of Tudor queens</b> and many notable names are connected with its history. 
Edward VI sold it to <b>Christopher Lytcott</b>, and it became the property of the 
<b>Backhouses</b>, whose monument is in the church, and then of <b>Viscount Cornbury</b>, 
afterward <b>second Earl of Clarendon</b>. It used to be said that the Earl of 
Clarendon wrote in this house <i>The History of the Great Rebellion,</i> but this 
appears not to be true.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">It was sold to Thomas Pitt, 
commonly called "Diamond" Pitt, or Governor Pitt, who made a great fortune in 
the East, and acquired the large diamond which will ever be associated with his 
name for £24,000. This possession caused no little anxiety and trouble. Lady 
Russell in her book tells the whole story of the stone. It was finally sold to 
the Duc d'Orleans for 
£125,000, receiving the name of "Regent", and after many vicissitudes is now in 
safe custody in the Louvre. I scarcely need mention the later owners of 
Swallowfield until it was acquired by Sir Henry Russell, Bart. He and his 
descendants have all been distinguished as soldiers or men of action, scholars 
and the friends of literary celebrities, members of parliament, etc.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The late Sir George was a man whom every one loved and 
admired. No one worked harder than he. He was a barrister, Member for East 
Berks, a Deputy Lieutenant for the county. Governor of Wellington College, 
Chairman of the South Eastern Railway Company, County Court Judge, and in spite 
of all his cares always the kind, genial, courteous friend whom we all admired. 
He married Constance, the daughter of the late Lord Arthur Lennox, She was the 
historian of Swallowfield, to whose work I have already acknowledged that I am 
indebted for all I know about her home. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">The old house has many 
charming family pictures by great painters, and a large library of books, which 
contains many treasures for the bibliophile. Not the least curious object is the 
magic crystal of the famous necromancer, astrologer and charlatan, <b>Dr. Dee</b>; but 
the power of reading its mysteries is, I fear, lost. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">A stroll through the village 
leads us to the hamlet of <b>Riseley</b>, and then on to <b>Heckfield Common</b>, one of the 
most beautiful in Northern Hants. It is beyond our borders, or I should like to 
describe the group of villages and interesting churches that lie in this 
district, Heckfield, Mattingley, Hartley Westpall and others. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">A few words must 
be said of <b>Stratfieldsaye</b> which is on the Berkshire border, the home of the 
great Duke of Wellington, presented to him by the nation for his signal 
services. The house is a plain building of little architectural interest, but 
profoundly interesting for its associations with the Duke. Some portions may 
have been built in the sixteenth century, but it has received so many additions 
and alterations that it is difficult to trace any early construction. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">In the time of Charles I the 
estate came into the possession of an ancestor of <b>Lord Rivers</b>, in whose family 
it remained until it was presented to the Duke. The house has many treasures. 
There are paintings of <b>Marshall Schomberg</b>, the hero of the <b>Battle of the Boyne</b>, 
Lord Wellington with his aide-de-camp, Lord Raglan, and their guides in their 
passage over the Pyrenees, of the Duke's triumphal entry into Madrid and other 
events in his military career; busts of famous men, such as the Emperor 
Alexander, the Duke of York, Sir Walter Scott, and of Massena, one of Napoleon's 
generals; a fine painting of the head of Copenhagen, the Duke's favourite 
charger, his accoutrements, etc., worn in his campaign. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Some of the relics of the old 
Roman city of <b>Silchester</b> are here, including one of the earliest mosaic 
pavements disinterred, forming the floor of the hall, and a bronze Roman eagle. 
There are portraits of great Spaniards, magnificently wrought keys of certain 
Spanish fortresses surrendered to the Duke, and almost everything in the house 
is an object of veneration to English people, telling of the mighty struggle of 
the nation a century ago. Outside in the park we notice the avenue of Cornish 
elms, a mile in length, recalling the lines of the poet Rogers:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: "><i><b>These are the groves a 
grateful people gave <br> For noblest service: and from age to age <br> May they to 
such as come with listening ear <br> Relate the story. </b></i> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">After the battle of Waterloo 
some beech trees were planted in the park and styled the Waterloo beeches. A 
story current in our neighbourhood is told of them which, as far as I am aware, 
has never been recorded in print. A lady named <b>Miss F. Landen</b>, desiring to 
sketch these trees, wrote to the Duke requesting permission to see the Waterloo 
beeches, and signing herself <i>F. Landen</i>. Whether her writing was difficult to 
read or the Duke's eyesight not quite so strong as it was, he read "beeches" as 
"breeches", and "Landen" as "London", and exclaimed, "Whatever does the Bishop 
of London mean by wanting to see my Waterloo breeches? Really his Lordship must 
be getting a little soft in the head". However the breeches were sent to the 
Bishop who was vastly astonished and said, "Whatever does the Duke mean by 
sending me these things? Really he must be suffering from softening of the 
brain!"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Across the park stands the 
curious church built of brick by Lord Rivers in 1874 in the shape of a Greek 
cross, with a west portico, a central octagonal tower crowned by a slated 
cupola. Its chief interest lies in its many monuments. There are some early 
brasses to the memory of members of the <b>Dabridgecourt </b>family who held the estate 
in the sixteenth century, a memorial to a former rector, <b>John Howsman</b>, "who 
continued a paynfull Preacher by the space of forty-one years". Lest the reader 
should feel too much compassion for the inhabitants during so long a period, it 
may be stated that the word "painful preacher" were understood by our 
forefathers to mean a "painstaking" one. I regret that space does not permit us 
to record the rest of these monuments. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Over thirty years ago some friends of the 
writer rented for the summer the rectory of <b>Stratfield Turgis</b>, an adjoining 
village. They were anxious to discover some of the old people who personally 
remembered the great Duke. Their quest was vain, until one day an old man 
brought some eggs to the rectory. Here they thought was their opportunity. He 
was conducted into the drawing-room, and asked many questions. But our country 
people are very cautious folk, and do not like to be questioned by strangers. At 
length after many essays the old man volunteered the startling and novel 
information, "I'm told, ma'am, he were very good at war". </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Before leaving this 
Berkshire border we must visit one village which has attained fame through the 
personal character and literary achievements of its rector, Charles Kingsley. 
That village is <b>Eversley</b>, which is easily approached from Stratfieldsaye by a 
road leading past the granite monument of the Duke, across Heckfield Heath, past 
the estate and mansion of <b>Viscount Eversley</b>, one of the most delightful drives 
or cycle rides imaginable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Though more than forty years have flown since Charles 
Kingsley died, his memory is ever green. It is not difficult to discover the 
secret of his appeal to the affectionate regard of men of divers temperaments. 
Some disliked his type of churchmanship, and yet he won the friendship of 
Archbishop Benson. He was not an accurate historian or leading scientist; yet 
men derived inspiration and an enthusiastic love of lore and learning from his 
writings and opened the book of nature under his guidance, and found therein 
light and knowledge. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Many know him only by his romances — and how stirring they 
are! Who has not been moved by <i>Westward Ho!</i> and realized from a study of its 
pages the gallantry of the seadogs of Devon, their bravery, their sufferings and 
their triumphs? Some call Kingsley a socialistic dreamer, and dislike his <i>Alton 
Locke</i> and <i>Two Years Ago</i>, and yet they proclaim him as the stalwart succourer of 
the oppressed, the lover of humanity, the champion of unpopular causes. However 
antagonistic his opponents were to his opinions, yet they all loved the man. He 
had a genius for friendship, and none revered him more than his parishioners. 
Even now the old people tell their stories about him and his curious ways and 
manners. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Pilgrims still come to visit Kingsley's beloved village,
<b>Eversley</b>, 
which lies just beyond our Berkshire border in Northern Hampshire, and we will 
follow in their footsteps. The best way is to hasten back to <b>Arborfield Cross</b> 
whence a road conveys us direct to Eversley Bridge, across the Blackwater river, 
and straight on to the vicarage and church. The latter is a curious structure 
quite unlike any other church. The chancel is the only ancient part; all the 
rest was rebuilt between 1724 and 1735, the tower being of the latter date. It 
was restored in 1863 and again in 1878 in memory of Charles Kingsley, who 
designed the paintings on the heavy classic chancel screen. In the church is a 
graceful modern effigy of <b>Dame Marianne Cope</b>, 1862, and a brass cross to the 
memory of <b>Richard Pendilton</b>, servant of <b>Giles Dawbney</b>, steward of Henry VII 
(1502). There are other memorials of the <b><a href="families_Cope.htm">Cope family</a></b> 
whose vault is beneath the chancel. In the dark south-west corner of the church 
is a tablet to the memory of <b>John James</b> who is described as the architect of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, 
Westminster Abbey, and fifty-four churches in the City of London. One wonders 
where <b>Sir Christopher Wren</b> comes in, in this mighty claim! </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">After viewing the church the 
pilgrim walks along the short narrow path that connects God's Acre with the 
rectory garden, and admires the giant cedar which was Kingsley's delight. This 
view is described by him in a letter written to his future wife:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: "><i><b>"The view is beautiful. The 
ground slopes upwards from the windows to a sunk fence and road without banks or 
hedges, and then rises in the furze hill in the drawing, which hill is perfectly 
beautiful in light and shade and colour. Behind the acacia in the lawn you get 
the first glimpse of the fir forests and moor, of which five-sixths of my parish 
consists. Those delicious self-sown first".</b></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
<img border="0" alt="Eversley Rectory" src ="../images/new/PD_Eversley_Rectory.jpg" width=405 height=305 ></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">By the courtesy of the present 
rector you may be able to see the old study, wherein the famous writer wrote his 
romances, his sermons, and prepared his lectures. Under the last rector, <b>Mr. 
Mosley</b>, it was much more luxurious than it was in Kingsley's time, with books 
galore and comfortable chairs wherein it was pleasant to take one's ease. When I 
first saw it in the days of Kingsley's successor it was a bare room with a brick 
floor, but there was a high standing desk on which he wrote his inimitable 
stories on half sheets of note-paper, which when they had been covered with his 
close script, were scattered on the floor, and must have been with some 
difficulty sorted. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Kingsley's old leaden tobacco-box and some other little 
relics have been handed down to posterity. He was very fond of smoking, and we 
still seem to see his familiar form, attired in very un-parsonic dress, with his 
knickerbockers and rough jacket, without even the customary white tie, walking 
with springing step over the heather-clad common, and suddenly darting into a 
furze-bush to seek for a long clay pipe that he had carefully hidden there, in 
case the lust for tobacco-smoking should suddenly come upon him without the 
wherewithal to gratify it. He had sundry of these hiding holes in various parts 
of his parish, where a pipe and 'baccy awaited him whenever he felt the need to 
use them. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">His eccentricities did but 
endear him to his many friends, and I could tell of many others. He had a 
passionate love for his "Winter Garden", that great stretch of country through 
which you can ride fifteen miles on end, wherein flourish great Scotch firs, 
bright hollies with their scarlet beads, furze patches rich with its lacework of 
interwoven light and shade, and the deep soft heather carpet, which invites you 
to lie down and dream for hours; and behind all the wall of fir-stems, and the 
dark fir-roof with its jagged edges a mile long against the soft grey sky. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He loved to ride through the fir-forests "with their 
endless vistas of smooth red green-veined shafts holding up the warm dark roof, 
lessening away into endless gloom, paved with rich brown fir-needle — a carpet at 
which nature had been at work for forty years. Red shafts, green roof, and here 
and there a pane of blue sky, while for incense I have the fresh healthy 
turpentine fragrance, far sweeter to my nostrils than the stifling narcotic 
odour which fills a Roman Catholic Cathedral".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Kingsley admired greatly the 
grand old moor, stretching its brown flats right away towards Windsor for many a 
mile, and the green wilderness of self-sown firs. "There they stand in 
thousands," he wrote, "the sturdy Scots, colonizing the desert in spite of 
frost, and gales, and barrenness ; and clustering, too, as Scotsmen always do 
abroad, little and big, every one under his neighbour's lee, according to the 
good old proverb of their native land, 'Caw me, and I'll caw thee'. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: " align="center"><i><b>"I respect 
these Scotch firs. I delight in their forms, from James I's gnarled giants up in 
Bramshill Park — the only place in England where a painter can learn what Scotch 
firs are — down to the little green pyramids which stand up out of the heather, 
triumphant over tyranny, and the strange woes of an untoward youth, seven years 
on an average have most of them spent in ineffectual efforts to become a foot 
high. Nibbled off by hares, trodden down by cattle, cut down by turf-parers, 
seeing hundreds of their brethren cut up and carried off in the turf-fuel they 
are as gnarled and stubbed near the ground as an old thorn-bush in a pasture. 
But they have conquered at last, and are growing away, eighteen inches a year, 
with fair green branches, silver-tipt, reclothing the wilderness with a 
vegetation which it has not seen — how many thousand years?” </b></i> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">I am not sure whether Kingsley 
was right. He thought the old Scotch firs disappeared from England with the 
glacial period, and were re-introduced, according to local tradition, by James I 
when he built the grand old house of Bramshill for his son Prince Henry, which 
we shall see presently. At any rate the firs are here. The winged seeds are 
carried by the south-west gales, and every seed takes root; and though thousands 
perish yearly, the eastern march goes on, up hill and down dale, covering the 
earth with a mantle of green.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Such is the onward march of the firs which we love to watch 
in these days as much as Kingsley did. But the woodman's axe is laying heavy 
toll upon our forests. Owing to the war ships can no longer bring to us the 
spoils of Norwegian woods, and we are obliged to help ourselves to our own 
native stock. So Canadian lumbermen, German prisoners and our own people are 
busily employed in cutting down these fir forests, and large tracts of country 
are as bare as barge-boards. But the heather will spring up again and the young 
firs seed and spread themselves, and there will be much planting, and nature 
will recover herself as England herself will do when the war is over, and we 
beat our swords into ploughshares and our spears into pruning-hooks. England 
like our fir forests has a wonderful capacity for recovery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">We pass with Kingsley through 
a gateway, out upon a village green, planted with rows of oaks, surrounded by 
trim sunny cottages, a pleasant oasis in the middle of the wilderness. A village 
cricket-ground where he used to play is in the centre. "We are great cricketers 
in these parts, and long may the good old game live among us”, he wrote. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">Kingsley loved hunting, and 
was a keen follower of <b>Sir John Cope's</b> and <b>Mr. Garth's</b> hounds, though in his 
Winter Garden he represents himself as a spectator only on his way to read to 
some old women in his parish like the good clergyman he was. But I have my 
doubts as to whether he did not ride after those hounds, although he asserts 
that his hunting days were over. He owns that "in the days of my vanity I have 
'frank delight of battle with my peers far on the ringing plains' of many a 
county, grass and forest, down and vale". And no one has expressed greater 
admiration for the hound or described him in better English, both in prose and 
verse, than Kingsley did.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: " align="center"><i><b>"Look at that old hound who stands doubtful, looking 
up at his master for advice. Look at the severity, delicacy, lightness of every 
curve. His head is finer than a deer's; his hind legs tense as steel springs; 
his fore-legs straight as arrows; and yet see the depth of his chest, the sweep 
of loin, the breadth of paw, the mass of arm and thigh, and if you have an eye 
for form, look at the absolute majesty of his attitude at this moment, majesty 
is the only word for it. If he were six feet high, instead of twenty-three 
inches, with what animal on earth could you compare him? Is it not a joy to see 
such a thing alive? It is to me, at least. I should like to have one in my study 
all day long, as I would have a statue or a picture, and when Mr. Morrell gave 
(as they say) two hundred guineas for Hercules alone, I believe the dog was well 
worth the money, only to look at". </b></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">A companion picture is that 
which he drew in his Ode to the brave North-Easter. The hounds seemed to have loved the poet-parson, and when 
the last day came, the day when he was buried in Eversley churchyard, the <b>
<a href="../memories_garth.htm">Garth 
Hunt</a></b> was there, riders and hounds, to pay their homage to their departed friend.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nor were they the only unaccustomed mourners at a 
graveside. In Kingsley's time there were many gipsy encampments on Eversley 
Common and in the district. These gipsies were very devoted to him, and called 
him their "Patrico-rai", or Priest-King, and Sir Charles Russell used to say 
that one of the most touching sights he had ever beheld was the grief of the 
vast concourse of gipsies who followed Kingsley to his grave. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eversley folk have 
become more civilized since his time. They were hethcroppers from time 
immemorial and poachers by instinct and heritage. They were descendants of many 
generations of broom-squires and deer-stealers, and the instinct of sport was 
strong within them, though no more of the king's deer were to be shot in the 
winter in the turnip fields, or caught by an apple-baited hook hung from an 
orchard bough. They limited their aspirations to hares and pheasants. Kingsley 
loved them, and they loved him. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">He describes the Eversley 
rustic as "a thorough good fellow, civil, contented, industrious, and often very 
handsome ; and a far shrewder fellow too — owing to his dash of wild forest 
blood, from gipsy, highwayman and what not — than his bullet-headed, and 
flaxen-polled cousin, the pure South-Saxon of the chalk downs. Dark-haired he 
is, ruddy, and tall of bone; swaggering in his youth; but when he grows old, a 
thorough gentleman, reserved, stately and courteous as a prince. Sixteen years 
have I lived with him, hail fellow well met, and never yet had a rude word or 
action from him." </p>
