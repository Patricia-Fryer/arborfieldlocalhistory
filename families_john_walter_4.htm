<p align="center"><b>LAMENTABLE ACCIDENT ON BEARWOOD LAKE.</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>An accident occurred on Saturday afternoon at Bearwood, the seat of <b>Mr. 
John Walter, M.P.</b>, which caused the loss of a very valuable life. There is a 
fine lake in front of the house, extending
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="View of the Lake from the Terrace" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Bearwood/College/Lake%20from%20Terrace_closeup.jpg" width=388 height=273 >over 
many acres, and in parts of considerable depth. </p>
<p>It affords in winter a splendid skating field, and it had been completely 
frozen over by the severe weather of last week. The family were assembled in the 
house to spend Christmas together, and in the afternoon a large party were 
enjoying themselves on the ice. <b>Mr. John Walter</b>, the eldest son, who had 
just returned from a lengthened tour, was skating with his brothers, <b>Mr. 
Arthur Walter</b> and <b>Mr. Henry Walter</b>. Another brother, <b>Mr. Thomas 
Walter</b>, was pushing his cousin Richard before him on a chair. </p>
<p>Mr. Walter himself, with some of his younger children, was upon another 
portion of the lake. On a sudden an alarm was raised, and on looking round, 
nothing could be seen of Mr. Thomas Walter and his cousin but their hands. They 
had fallen into the water at one of the deepest parts of the lake, where the 
waterfowl had kept the water open as long as possible, and where the ice 
consequently was weakest. Mr. Walter and his two brothers skated as rapidly as 
possible to the spot, and found Mr. Thomas Walter clinging to the broken ice 
with one hand, and supporting his cousin with his dis-engaged arm.</p>
<p>

<p>[<i>Bearwood Lakes, as shown on the Bearwood Estate Map - by courtesy of 
Bearwood College</i>]</p>
<p>Mr. John Walter instantly threw himself upon the ice, and stretched out his 
arm, but he had scarcely reached his brother’s hand when the ice gave way 
beneath him, and he, too, was immersed. On seeing this, Mr. Henry Walter 
promptly followed his brother’s example, and stretched himself along the ice to 
rescue his two brothers and his cousin. But just as his elder brother had 
grasped his hand, the ice gave way under him also, and four of them were thus in 
the water together. Both Mr. John Walter and his brother were excellent 
swimmers, and had perfect confidence in themselves; but their position was 
evidently perilous. Meanwhile, Mr. Arthur Walter, with great presence of mind, 
had skated as fast as he could towards the home farm, calling out as he went for 
assistance and for a rope. Happily his cries were heard, and a rope was at hand. 
It was soon brought to the spot, but too late to save a very precious life. Mr. 
John Walter had disappeared. His brothers said he sank almost immediately after 
Mr. Henry Walter’s effort had failed.</p>
<p>It is evident he had suffered one of those seizures by which the strongest 
and most experienced swimmers are from time to time overpowered. The annals of 
bathing, and bathing at our schools and universities, record several such 
melancholy instances. Such seizures are generally ascribed to cramp, but they 
are probably due to some sudden determination of the blood to the head, and in 
the present instance this was rendered the more probable by the extreme cold of 
the water. The other two brothers were much exhausted, and Mr. Thomas Walter, 
who was the longest immersed, says he believes he was only kept from sinking by 
the sense that his cousin was depending on him. The rope, however, was in time 
to save the other lives which were imperilled. The weaker ice had been broken 
away, and it was possible to approach the edge of the water. Mr. Thomas Walter 
and his cousin were rescued by means of the rope, and Mr. Henry Walter was 
extricated by a boatman. Mr. John Walter seems never to have risen to the 
surface after he first disappeared, and his body was only recovered after a four 
hours’ search.</p>
<p>There are circumstances which render this calamity particularly startling and 
distressing. About a year and a half ago, after an honourable course at Eton and 
at Oxford, Mr. John Walter started on what is now the grand tour, to go round 
the world, and see all forms of human civilisation. He went by the Baltic to St. 
Petersburg, and thence across Russia to the Caucasus, and thence to 
Constantinople and the Holy Land. He proceeded through the Suez Canal and the 
Red Sea to India, and saw the principal cities of our Eastern Empire. After 
visiting Australia, he returned by China and Japan to the North American 
continent, and traversed the United States from west to east. He was expected 
home some days before Christmas, and his friends had been joyfully awaiting his 
return. He reached home safely on Thursday evening, to the extreme delight of 
his family, and to the apparent fulfilment of their brightest hopes. Within 
forty-eight hours he had been snatched from them for ever on this side of the 
grave. </p>
<p>It is one of those dispensations of Providence of which we can see nothing 
but the mystery, and which it needs the strongest faith to support with 
resignation. For a private calamity, it is hard to conceive a greater. Mr. John 
Walter was 25 years of age. As we have said, he had passed an honourable as well 
as blameless career as a boy and a student. His abilities were great, and his 
character was admirable. His rare natural goodness of disposition was enhanced 
and animated by a most profound and unaffected piety. To a vigorous frame he 
joined an active mind and a manly heart, and he was guided and sustained by firm 
religious principles. To these qualities he had just added the most instructive 
experience now open to a young man, and he had fully availed himself of its 
advantages. </p>
<p>When he reached his home on Thursday, his life was fraught with very high 
promise, not only to his family, but to a far wider circle, if not to the public 
at large, and its sudden eclipse is overwhelming to those by whom he was known 
and beloved. It may seem a mockery to seek for any topic of consolation in the 
presence of such an irreparable sorrow. Yet, if it is strange and bitter that a 
young man should be spared through all the perils of extreme climates and 
dangerous voyages, and, at the very moment when he and his friends were most 
thankful for his safety, should die by a common accident within sight of his 
father’s house, it is something that he should have returned to revive, before 
he departed, the remembrance of his virtues and his love, instead of passing out 
of sight in a foreign land. He lived long enough, at all events, to die for 
others, and his death binds him still more closely to his home and to those who 
are most afflicted by his loss – <b><i>Times</i></b>. </p>
<p>On Monday morning [Boxing Day] an inquest was held at <b>Bearwood</b>, on the body of the 
deceased, before <b>W. Weedon, Esq., Coroner</b>, and of the following jury:-</p>
<p><b>The Rev. Sir John Warren Hayes, Bart.</b> [Rector of Arborfield], foreman; <b><br>Sir John Conroy, 
Bart.</b> [of Arborfield Grange, late of Arborfield Hall],<br><b>Rev. J. T. Brown</b>, <br><b>Rev. Dolben Paul</b> 
[Rector of Bearwood],<br><b>Rev. Wyndham 
Hugh D’Aeth</b> [Curate of Arborfield],<br><b>J. Simonds, Esq.</b> [the second, 
of Newlands],&nbsp; <br><b>J. Simonds, jun., Esq.</b> [the third, of Newlands], <br><b>
Capt. Gray Skipwith</b>, <br><b>R. H. Thorold, Esq.</b>, <br><b>T. Harman, Esq.</b>, <br><b>
F. Sarnay, Esq.</b>, <br><b>W. H. Pratt, Esq.</b>, <br>and <b>Joseph Lawes, Esq.</b> </p>
<p>The inquest was held in the library of the mansion. After the jury had viewed 
the body, the evidence of <b>George Webb</b>, a carpenter in the employ of Mr. Walter, 
who witnessed the accident, and of <b>James Rackley</b>, the old fisherman who assisted 
in rescuing those immersed, was taken. James Dance having proved the finding of 
the deceased near the opening where he had fallen in, the Coroner said: "There 
are no other witnesses, gentlemen, and I think you will be perfectly satisfied 
that it was an accident".</p>
<p>The jury acquiesced.</p>
<p>The Foreman, addressing the Rev. Dolben Paul, said, - Before we separate, I 
think we should all express our deep sympathy with the family on the death of 
Mr. John Walter in his attempt to rescue his brother and cousin, and request 
that you will kindly convey that expression of sympathy to the family.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. T. Brown. – It is a very sad event, and it seems to have reached 
every home and every heart, and to have clouded every family at this festive 
season. It shaded the joy of every one.</p>
<p>The Rev. Sir John Hayes. – All the poor of Arborfield feel it extremely.</p>
<p>The jury gave their fees to the Rev. Dolben Paul for the poor of the parish.</p>
<p>The sad event cast a gloom over the entire neighbourhood, and on Sunday, 
touching references were made to it by the Rev. Dolben Paul and other clergymen. 
The deceased was generally beloved, and highly respected, and his premature and 
untimely death will long be lamented.</p>

<p>The news of the sad calamity at Bearwood, which has created to painful a 
reaction throughout the district, reached this office on Saturday afternoon, and 
as the melancholy tiding became generally known, most heartfelt were the 
expressions of sorrow heard on all sides. </p>
<p>To very many, Mr. John Walter, jun., was personally known and beloved, whilst 
all have cause to respect and honour the head of the family, whose great 
liberality and kindness are justly appreciated; and it may perhaps give a silver 
lining to the dark cloud which now hangs so heavily over Bearwood, for its 
mourning occupants to know that their grief is shared by all their neighbours, 
both rich and poor. Indeed, the sudden removal from amongst us of the valuable 
life, so full of bright hope and promise, is felt as a personal loss by each 
inhabitant of the district, and universal sympathy is expressed for the members 
of the deeply-afflicted family. </p>
<p>The account of the melancholy accident and of the inquest, will be found in 
another column of this Journal. We understand that the funeral takes place this 
day (Saturday) at St. Catherine’s, Bearwood, at 1.30 p.m.; Messrs Netherclift 
and Gilbert, of London-street, Reading, are entrusted with the arrangements. </p>

<font size="2">
<p>The funeral of the late Mr. John Walter, junr., took place at St. Catherine’s 
Church, Bearwood, on Saturday. The high esteem in which the deceased was held, 
was manifest by the large attendance of people of all ranks who crowded the 
church and churchyard. The funeral took place shortly before 2 o’clock. The 
deceased was followed to the grave by the members of the family, and a number of 
relatives and friends, including many old College friends. </p>
<p>The coffin was covered with fine black cloth with silver furniture. The plate 
bore the following inscription: - "<b>       
  John B</b>             
     <b> alston Walter, Born March 23, 1846, 
died December 24, 1870</b>". On the pall were placed a large cross of white 
camelias, and also a wreath of white flowers. The undertakers were Messrs. 
Netherclift and Gilbert, of London-street, Reading. The service in the church 
was conducted by the late incumbent, the <b>Rev. W. H. E. Welby</b>, vicar of 
Grantham, and at the grave by the <b>Rev. Dolben Paul</b>, the present rector. 
At the vault a large crowd of people assembled, and the deepest sorrow was 
depicted on every countenance. Many persons availed themselves of the 
opportunity of viewing the coffin, after it had been conveyed to its final 
resting-place and a most profound sense of grief was everywhere visible. At 
Wokingham and the adjacent villages business was almost entirely suspended and 
the greatest respect was shown to the memory of the deceased.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the <b>Wokingham Town Council</b> on Thursday, a vote of 
condolence with Mr. Walter and his family on their irreparable loss was 
unanimously carried. Mr. Alderman Page brought forward the motion, and in 
introducing it, alluded to the connection of Mr. Walter’s family with the 
borough.</p>
