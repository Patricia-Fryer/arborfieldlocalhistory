village street, mid June, about 1910; I am a small boy about 7 years old, just 
old enough to take an inquisitive interest in the activities of the grown-ups in 
our village.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Meet me outside </span>Newlands Farm<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
at about five minutes to eight. The sun is shining, the birds singing and 
faintly in the distance you can hear the chatter of a mowing machine cutting the 
grass to make hay (the tail grass always cuts cleaner while the morning dew is 
still about). </span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><a href="images/Collier/Collier_A511.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Newland Farm in about 1910" vspace   =5 align=right src="images/Street_1910/Newland%20Farm.jpg" width=228 height=151 ></a></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Listen, if the wind is in the 
right direction we shall hear: dong, dong, dong, dong, eight times. This is the 
clock at Arborfield Hall striking eight; the man looking over the fence in the 
farmyard is  </span>Mr Charlie Lucas<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. He is checking his watch, as will most of the 
locals, for Arborfield Hall clock keeps very accurate time. Mr Lucas has just 
fed a dozen fine young bullocks in the stockyard that he is fattening for the Fatstock Market in Reading just before Christmas. There is very little activity 
in the farmyard, as most of the farmhands have been working in the fields for 
nearly an hour already.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Pond_2.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Pond in about 1910, with Pond Cottages behind - from the Collier Collection" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Street_1910/Pond_2.jpg" width=240 height=156 ></a>We now move on for about fifty 
yards and stop at the village pond, where cattle and horses drink; the ducks on 
the pond going about their business with their rear ends up in the air, their 
beaks very active beneath the water after minnows, tadpoles and other creatures 
that live in the pond. On the far side of the pond in a clump of rushes you will 
see Mr and Mrs Moorhen and some newly hatched chicks darting about playing 
amongst the rushes and pond weeds. There is a natural springing at the further 
side of which keeps the water quite clear in spite of the many animal feet that 
walk through it during the day. This is where the children slide when the water 
is frozen for several days during the winter.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Collier/Collier_B913.jpg">
<img border="0" alt="The Notice-boards at the Police House" align =right src="images/Collier/Collier_B913_detail.jpg" width=127 height=145 ></a>Pond Cottages overlook the pond 
and the one on the right is the home of  </span>Mr, or PC, Prior<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> the 
local policeman. He is well liked by the majority of the local inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Just inside his gate is the POLICE NOTICE BOARD upon which are all the 'Official 
Notices' and local Byelaws. His main problems are the occasional case of 
drunkenness, gipsy intruders, poachers and small boys who, in those days, 
require to be reprimanded for occasional mischief. His garden is very tidy and 
well cultivated and makes a very pleasant background to the village pond, In the 
house next door lives </span>Mr Arbery<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, butler to  </span>Mr John Simonds<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> of Newlands, who owns most of the property in 
Arborfield and Newlands. This house, until a few years ago, was the home of a </span>
Mr Haines<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, the constable before Mr Prior.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Before we come to the main 
road, there is, on the right-hand side, a triangle of grass where there are two 
horse chestnuts and one very large oak tree. On the three sides of the triangle 
there are hard surfaced gravel roads.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Collier/Collier_A509.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Bull - from the Collier Collection" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Street_1910/Bull.jpg" width=246 height=167 ></a>Over the main road to the Bull Inn; the landlord is  </span>Mr Joseph Bushell<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. He has 
not been in the "Bull" very long; before he came, the landlord was  </span>Mr Rayner<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. Mr 
Bushell will no doubt be out on his rounds of the woods to keep an eye on the 
pheasants and other game. He will have several bags containing corn, which he 
will scatter in the woods to encourage the birds to nest and remain within the 
cover. Strapped to the cross-bar of his bicycle is a double barrel twelve bore 
shotgun and the bag slung over his shoulder contains the cartridges to have a 
shot at the numerous wildlife that prey on the game birds, mostly weasels, 
stoats, jays and magpies. Most of the pheasants have been hatched and reared in 
the paddock adjoining the "Bull". In the spring, Mr Bushell will have visited 
local farmers and those who keep poultry to collect broody hens under which the 
pheasants' eggs will have been hatched.<a href="images/Village_Pond.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Parish Cottages on Swallowfield Rd., opposite the Bull" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Street_1910/Parish_Cottages.jpg" width="149" height="95"></a></span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Opposite the "Bull" there is a 
single storey building, which contains almshouses, property of the Parish 
Council. The one on the right is occupied by an elderly widow,  </span>Mrs Love<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, and the 
one next door, by  </span>Polly Lunn<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> (a local character) and her elderly brother, 
 
</span>Alfred<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. Both are simple folk, but with odd jobs they do within the village and 
some assistance from the Board of Guardians, they always appear clean and tidy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1170168.HTML">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Garretts' Yard, in winter, mid-1920's" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/Street_1910/Garretts.jpg" width="251" height="155"></a>Now on to the builders' yard to the right-hand side of the 'street'. The local 
builders, the  </span>Garrett Brothers<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">,  </span>Arthur, Alf and Ted<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - three very popular members 
of the Cricket Club. Arthur is also Clerk to the two separate Parish Councils of Arborfield and Newland. In their yard a horse-drawn van is being loaded with 
building materials; they will be off to do some house repairs or to decorate the 
outside or inside of one of the local houses. There are several cottages within 
the village that were built by  </span>Mr George Garrett<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, father of the present 
brothers. The Garretts' house is next adjoining their yard.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Cross_2.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Lanka House, now known as Fairway House" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Street_1910/Lanka_House.jpg" width="213" height="178"></a>Across 
the road is the most imposing house in the village street, facing straight down 
the Reading Road. Look over the front hedge - the garden is laid out in small 
beds to an artistic design and bordered by small box hedging about eight inches 
high - all beautifully clipped - and the beds are planted with begonias. If the 
front door is open, look inside and you may see </span>Mr Arthur Taylor<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, 
the local tailor, sitting cross-legged on a very large table, making a hand suit 
of breeches or perhaps a jacket of 'Hunting Pink' for a local landowner or 
farmer. It is reputed that any article of clothing made by </span>Mrs Taylor<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
is probably pressing a garment made by her husband with a huge iron, heated on 
the hob built into the wall at the side of the tailor's workroom. Arthur is 
another stalwart member of the Cricket Club.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Now back to the other side of 
the street. There are two cottages adjoining the Garretts' house; one is 
occupied by  </span>Mr and Mrs Alexander<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. Mr Alexander could be just coming out of his 
gate wheeling a bicycle, dressed in a smart green uniform with peaked hat and a 
black band over his left shoulder across his back and under his right arm - like 
a bandolier with a small oblong pack <a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Cross_2.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Cottages beyond the Garretts' Yard" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Street_1910/Garretts2.jpg" width=272 height=175 ></a>attached to it, which I understand contains 
first aid requirements - for he is the first AA Patrolman in the district. His 
beat is from Reading to Eversley Bridge, to assist any unfortunate motorists 
whose vehicle has a puncture or has broken down. This is not at all uncommon as 
all the roads are gravel surfaced and the odd nail or stud that has dropped from 
the many horse-drawn vehicles that go to and fro through the street may find its 
way into a tyre.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Now we are outside the last 
cottage of the block. Here lives  </span>Mr and Mrs William Cox<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> and their young son, 
 
</span>Young Willie Cox<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, Arborfield's first telegraph boy, with his new red bicycle. He 
will deliver telegrams from Arborfield Cross Post Office over a wide area - 
Farley Hill, Bearwood and Sindlesham, Barkham and as far as West Court on the 
Eversley Road. His father works for the Garrett Brothers and is also the Sexton 
at Arborfield Church. As Garretts are the Undertakers, this works very well, as 
the Sexton is required to toll the knell when there is a death in the parish, 
and to dig the grave and complete the task after the funeral service.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Sale_1947_Lot13.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Mileham Cottage, taken in 1994" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Street_1910/Mileham_Cottage.jpg" width="139" height="116"></a>Next-door 'Mileham Cottage' 
built by old  </span>Jim Taylor<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, named after his wife who was a  </span>Miss Mileham<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. Jim was a 
bricklayer by trade, working for the old George Garrett. He built the cottage 
for himself and lives there with his two daughters. Both girls are teachers at 
Arborfield School, Nell the elder and Frances, who as well as teaching, is the 
Organist at Arborfield Church.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Across the road is a footpath 
that goes past three cottages to School Road. The first is occupied by the 
Mabett family;  </span>Mr Mabett<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> is a chauffeur to Mr John Simonds. Next-door  </span>Mr and Mrs 
Chambers<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, Edward (or Teddy as he is generally known), is a carpenter, a skilled 
craftsman working for the Garrett brothers. Any carpentry completed by Teddy is 
a work of art, perfect in every detail. He is also a member of the Cricket Club 
- a very safe pair of hands behind the wicket. Next door again, live  </span>Mr and Mrs 
Charlie Selwood<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> and Charles their son, known to 
everyone as </span>Sammy<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. Both men work for </span>
Mr Lucas<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Post_Office_2.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Post Office and adjoining cottages" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/Street_1910/Post_Office.jpg" width="279" height="161"></a>Back now to the main road. 
Adjoining the Mabetts' cottage is one occupied by </span>Harry Salisbury<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, a widower 
with </span><a href="pictures_Wokingham_Lane.htm">several children</a><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. He is a farrier working for </span>Mr Mattingley<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> just a little 
further on beyond the Post Office.
It is only recently that Arborfield has a proper Post Office, with a counter and 
telegraph facilities, with a small switchboard to the few houses in the area 
that boast a telephone. </span>Mrs Mattingiey<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> is the Postmistress; before, all postal 
business was conducted in the living room within the house. You can see the slot 
in the front door where letters were posted - at the time of writing the 
original door is still there! </span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><a href="images/Collier/Collier_39.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Blacksmith's adjoining the Post Office" vspace  =5 align=right src="images/Street_1910/Blacksmith.jpg" width=241 height=211 ></a>Arthur Emblen<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> is the Postman&nbsp; 
known&nbsp; to&nbsp;everyone as 'Plummy Emblen',&nbsp;he lives in Swallowfield Road. When out 
of uniform he repairs boots, shoes and harness in his little workshop, in his 
spare time. Next to the Post Office is the Blacksmith's Shop, owned by </span>Mr Mattingley<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. All day long from dawn to dusk you can hear the ring of the anvil. 
Mr Salisbury will be shoeing a horse - each shoe is made individually from a bar 
of iron and fitted with great care. You can smell the tang of the burning hoof 
as it is fitted and trimmed. There is probably another horse standing outside 
waiting its turn, and, during the holiday time groups of children stand and 
watch and listen to the conversation that Mr Salisbury keeps up with them and 
the horses - and language that only horses are supposed to understand. </span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Opposite are the two cottages built 
about twenty years ago by George Garrett; they are tied cottages for the 
employees of Newlands Farm,
</span>Mr Hall<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> in one and the other awaiting a 
new tenant.
</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Swan_5.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The Swan, the two tied cottages, Mileham Cottage and beyond" vspace   =5 align=left src="images/Street_1910/Swan_5.jpg" width=288 height=205 ></a>Now 
we have the Swan Inn, Landlord </span><a href="families_Clark.htm">Mr William Clark</a><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, 
a retired sergeant major and a very strict man who has retained his military 
bearing and discipline at all times. He has a very large garden, keeping several 
pigs in a big sty in the garden, and in the yard at the side of the inn there is 
stabling for several horses and also a large coach house. Mr Clark has no horses 
but the buildings are used to house poultry - hens, ducks and geese. </span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">From time to time a travelling 
'Cheap Jack' sets up his booth in the yard, selling pots and pans, china and 
crockery, cutlery, cut throat razors, boot and shoe laces, and a hundred and one 
other household requirements. For the children there are dolls, toys and a very 
sticky toffee, which we call 'stick-jaw', aniseed balls and butterscotch. At 
night his display is illuminated with two paraffin oil flares and that, with his 
cries of "Walk up, walk up, ladies and gentlemen!" makes quite a gay setting to 
the "Swan".</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">You will have noticed many 
schoolchildren crossing the green opposite, going by the footpath across  </span>Mr 
Isaacs'<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> field to school. They have come from many different directions, some 
even from Farley Hill and Maggs Green, and some whose parents are poorly paid, 
wearing wooden soled clogs. These wear wonderfully well and easy for Dad to 
repair. All will be wearing satchels or if there is more than one in the family, 
the eldest will be in charge and wearing the satchel containing their dinner. It 
is not uncommon for some children to have eaten their food before getting to 
school, as hunger was well known in large families.<br>
&nbsp;<a href="images/BIRCH%20HOUSE%20-%20WARTIME.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Birch House in the 1940's - covered in ivy" vspace  =5 align=right src="images/Street_1910/Birch%20House.jpg" width=153 height=124 ></a><br>
At the side of the Green is the stable and coach house of what is now known as 
'Birch House' - occupant </span>Major O'Rourke<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> — 
one of the first officers to arrive in the village attached to the new Army 
Remount Depot on property recently purchased by the Military Authorities. Major 
O'Rourke takes a keen interest in the local Boy Scouts, organising paper chases, 
athletics and boxing. He is very keen on self-defence and has provided boxing 
gloves and gives instruction, acting as Referee and peacemaker when fisticuffs 
get a little rough. There has been many a bloody nose on that piece of grass.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><a href="images/Sunrise.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Sunrise - hundreds of years older than it seems" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Street_1910/Sunrise.jpg" width=156 height=119 ></a>On the other side of the road a 
house occupied by  </span>Mr Palmer<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> with his wife, son and daughter,  </span>Frank<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> and  </span>Minnie<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. 
Mr Palmer is baker to  </span>Mr Seymour<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> at the village shop. The bread that he has made 
sends a wonderful smell along the street. He would have been at work for over 
three hours now and from seven o'clock when the first batch of bread came from 
the oven the smell of hot new bread has been whetting the appetites of passers 
by. The loaves will be loaded into two carts to deliver bread and flour 
throughout Arborfield and Newland, Farley Hill and parts of Barkham.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Now to the Wheelwright's 
workshop on the left hand side of the street belonging to my father, </span>
George Bentley<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, known to his fellow members of 
the Cricket club as 'Chummy'. He has been a bell ringer with the Garrett 
Brothers and others, following their fathers, when the new church was built in 
1863. The Wheelwright's business has belonged to our family for many years; 
there is no record of when the business first started, but it was known that the 
Bentleys had lived there well before 1800. In the late 1800's the business was 
carried on by </span>Mr William Vincent<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, 
coachbuilder, who later was the founder of 'Vincent's of Reading' in Castle 
Street. It was returned to my father in 1903.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">If you look through the large 
double doors you would see farm cart or wagon being made or repaired, milk 
floats, wheelbarrows, and ladders and many other implements for an estate or 
farm in the surrounding district. Each item or vehicle was given a primary coat 
of paint before being put in the paint shop for its second and final coat of 
paint and a final coat of varnish. </span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">If you listen you will hear </span>
Alfred Attwood<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> in the Blacksmith's shop at the 
back of the workshop making all the ironwork required for whatever is being made 
in the Wheelwright's shop. (Before Alfred, the Blacksmith was William Harding 
who has worked there since boyhood and is now in his eighties. He could neither 
read nor write but his skill with ironwork was wonderful). Like all Blacksmiths 
he wears a leather apron to prevent the sparks from the red and often white hot 
iron burning his clothes. </span>Mr Charlie Cox<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
is the Wheelwright, a very gentle man but skilled and industrious, a perfect 
timekeeper, never a minute early or late.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">

is a stable for our horses, Joe and Coker, and two sheds for our own vehicles. A 
large open-ended shed has just been built for the seasoning timber. Outside in 
the paddock there are many trunks or butts of trees that are laid out awaiting 
the arrival of a mobile saw bench drawn by a big traction engine belonging to  </span>Mr 
Dixon<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> of Finchampstead. The trees will be sawn into planks of various thickness, 
ash, oak and elm to any thickness from three to six inches and softer wood from 
by two down to less than an inch. The planks will be laid in the open-ended shed 
each with strips laid between and stacked one upon the other to 'season'. These 
are very carefully placed, with a spirit level, to make sure that when dry they 
can be used.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Before the advent of the steam 
driven saw, the timber was sawn by hand in the saw pit in the yard, with a huge 
crosscut saw - one man at the top and one in the pit below; a very uncomfortable 
place to be in hot weather.</span></p>

<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Magnolia Cottage, taken in 1957" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Street_1910/Magnolia%20Cottage%201957.jpg" width=232 height=158 ></a>Next is the house adjoining the wheelwright's shop, my home. The house has been 
in our family since some time in the 1700's except for a short time between 1875 
and 1900. An uncle of mine was born there in 1826 and he was the youngest of the 
fourth generation to have lived in this house. On the brick pillar at the gate 
there is a brass plate, which reads "Doctors Walker and Halpin, Surgeons". 
Surgery is held in the sitting room of the house twice a week.  </span>Dr Walker<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> is 
quite elderly and only treats patients at Swallowfield.  </span>Dr Halpin<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> does his 
rounds on a motor bicycle; when he first came into the practice he rode a 
bicycle, but now talks of owing a motorcar. It is necessary to go to 
Swallowfield to collect medicine and this is usually done by bicycle or pony and 
trap.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Shop_1.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Beech House and the Shop then adjoining it" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Street_1910/Shop.jpg" width="201" height="140"></a>Now on the right hand side of 
the street is the village shop where most of the local inhabitants buy 
practically all their requirements - groceries, meat, bread, chocolate, sweets, 
tobacco, cigarettes, snuff, chewing twist, drapery, children's clothing, 
crockery, ironmongery, corn and meal for poultry and pigs, coal, paraffin oil 
and a hundred and one other items.  </span>Mr F.W. Seymour<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> is the proprietor and he took 
over the business about ten years ago. Before Mr Seymour it was Mr Bundy and the 
previous owner was Mr Giles, and earlier still Mr Hart, the first baker in the 
village.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The footpath next to the shop 
crosses the field to Arborfield Court and through to Wokingham Lane and Farley 
Hill. </span>Mrs Bruce<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> lives in the Court, only 
recently built and completed in 1906. In the summer time the walk across the 
fields is very popular and pleasant. On Sunday evenings it is possible to see 
several families going for a pleasant stroll through the woods to Farley Hill 
Church. If you stand by the pond in the corner of the field next to the gate, on 
fine evenings you may hear music, either a brass band or someone playing a 
musical instrument, or singing a well-known song. The sound is produced by a 
gramophone in the cottage across the footpath; it belongs to </span>Mr and Mrs 
Harrington<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. This is the first gramophone that 
many village folk have ever heard and the records are cylindrical. It has a huge 
horn and when played by the open window the sound can be heard distinctly in the 
village.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<a href="images/Collier/Collier_A513.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Whitewell Cottage, with Well in the front, workshops to left and Peacock Cottage to right" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/Street_1910/whitewell_cottage.jpg" width="349" height="190"></a>Over the road from the footpath 
is "Whitewell Cottage" built in 1847 by my grandfather. Up to a few years ago 
the village well, "Whitewell", was in the front garden of the cottages but as 
most of the village folk get their drinking water from the well, the fence has 
been moved behind the well, giving easy access without going into the garden. 
All day long from dawn to dusk men will be seen going to and from the well 
carrying two buckets either in their hands or on a pair of yokes across their 
shoulders, fetching water for drinking and washing. This is a natural spring. If 
you lift the lid you will see the well is practically full of clear cool water. 
It is just over five feet deep and has never been known to run dry.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Now we have "Peacock Cottage", 
the only thatched cottage in the village street. In the garden is a yew tree 
clipped in the shape of a peacock. It is one of the oldest dwellings in the 
district with a wooden frame. Some of the walls are wattle and daub and what 
brickwork there is has been hand-made as the bricks vary in shape and size. 
There is a cellar beneath the bedroom with a spring in the corner, which 
obviously is connected to the "Whitewell". The District Nurse lives here, 
she is a widow, </span>Mrs Hogg<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, with two 
children and she does her rounds on a bicycle.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Looking at the surface of the 
road, there are several damp patches and there is a trickle of water running 
down the verge of the road. This comes from the spring in the bank; including 
the "Whitewell" there are several active springs here. It is a local belief that 
if we are due for a spell of fine weather the springs are more active.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">On the right hand side, 
situated on the bank, there is a danger sign. On an iron stake with a red 
triangle at the top, and beneath on iron plate with the words "WARNING - PLEASE 
DRIVE SLOWLY THROUGH THE VILLAGE". Quite frequently a horse and cart pass at 
quite a sharp gallop and several motorcars may go through during the course of 
the day, leaving a cloud of dust, blown up from the gravel road. There are no 
footpaths either side of the road for the full length of the village street. On 
the left hand side on the bank for about 100 yards there are several very large 
elm trees. The field over this bank is known as "Jagletts".</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">We are now at the top of the 
hill, the highest point of the village street. During the summer holidays Mr 
Seymour allows us children to fly our kites from the field on the right; both 
home-made kites and those purchased in Reading or Wokingham, can be seen high in 
the sky towards the "Coombes". The prevailing wind is usually from the east and 
many a penny ball of string has been purchased from the shop for the larger 
kites that fly quite high and a considerable distance away according to the 
strength of the wind.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Our stroll through the village 
has taken nearly an hour. At nine o'clock the school bell will ring and if you 
listen you will hear clip, clop, clip, clop, the sound of horses hooves and iron 
tyres on the gravel road. These are the milk floats returning from Wokingham 
Station to the local farms. The milk from last evening and this morning's 
milking have been taken in seventeen-gallon churns to the station and is now 
half way to London on the "Milk Train".</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">From this spot in the winter on 
frosty mornings one can hear the trains shunting about in the Wokingham Goods 
yard at the station. Should the wind be in the east it is possible to hear the 
empty milk churns being unloaded on the platform, and the trains on their run 
between Sindlesham Halt and Wokingham.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">We now near the end of the 
"Village Street", just down the hill are a pair of cottages built for Mr Hart at 
the shop. </span>Mr Hart<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> was the first village 
baker in about the 1880's. He delivered the newly baked bread through the 
district carrying the bread in two large baskets, which he carried on his arm. 
The cottages are occupied by </span>Mr Tom Edwards<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, 
an employee at the Remount Depot. Next door lived </span>Mr and Mrs John 
Humphries<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> and he is the "Road Man". Heaps of gravel are put at convenient places 
by the road from the Parish boundary between Shinfield and Arborfield to the 
Farley Hill turning on the Eversley Road, and John with his wheelbarrow, 
pickaxe, shovel and hammer, repairs the pot holes as they appear throughout the 
village. Mrs Humphries is one of the wonderful women who are found in villages 
throughout England, taking in washing, acting as midwife and nurse (before the 
arrival of </span>Mrs Hogg<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">) and also there when 
there is a death in the village to comfort the bereaved and to do the laying 
out. She can be seen going from one of her many 'good deeds' always wearing a 
spotlessly white pinafore and carrying under her arm the tools for whichever 
task she had or was about to perform.</span></p> 
       
<p class="sthead"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Opposite to Harts Cottages is 
the chapel - Arborfield Free Church, with its stable and coach house at the 
back. The preacher usually comes from Reading in a pony and trap. Several locals 
often take both the morning and evening services. There is always a good 
attendance, and on Sundays when the weather is warm enough the windows are open 
wide and the vocal effect of both the preacher and congregation can be heard for 
some distance away. One evening during the week there is 'Band of Hope' for the 
younger generation.</span></p>
