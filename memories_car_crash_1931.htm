        <p class="stbody">By 1931, cars and motor-cycles were increasing in 
        traction power, but they weren't quite so good in stopping. There were 
        very many road accidents; in only ten months between January and 
        October, there were around 1000 accidents and 10 fatalities within the 
        Reading Borough boundary. Outside the towns, the country roads were 
        generally in poor condition, and the <b>Reading - Eversley Road</b> 
        didn't get a Tarmac surface until the 1930s.&nbsp; Two fatal road 
        accidents occurred on this road within 4 months. Here is the second, as 
        reported by the '<b>Reading Mercury</b>' on December 12th:</p>

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">
        STEAM WAGGON “IN DANGEROUS POSITION”</font></span></b></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Harold T. Goodey</b>, Twyford 
        Car Dump, was fined £2 at the Wokingham Police Court for leaving a steam 
        waggon in a dangerous position on the Eversley – Reading Road.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>P. C. Keene</b> said he saw the 
        wagon on the wrong side of the road drawing water. Beyond the wagon a 
        man was lying injured in the road and a motor-car was in the ditch on 
        the off-side of the road. The car had been travelling in the opposite 
        direction to the wagon and had struck the near side wing of the vehicle. 
        The driver was knocked unconscious and had fallen out of the car which 
        had run into the ditch.</span></p>

        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Stated to have received serious 
        injuries when his car collided with the side of a steam wagon, <b>Andrew 
        Thomas Andrews</b>, a commercial traveller (32) of 46 Somerset Road, 
        South Farnborough, Hants., died in the Royal Berkshire Hospital, 
        Reading. The inquest was held at Reading Coroner’s Court on Saturday 
        morning before <b>Mr. J. L. Martin</b>, the Reading borough coroner, who 
        sat with a jury. <b>Mr. J. A. Brain</b> appeared for the employers of 
        Andrews, and <b>Mr. E. D. Berry</b> for the driver.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>P. C. Keene</b>, of Arborfield, 
        said he arrived at the scene of the accident, which had taken place a 
        little on the Reading side of the Remount Depot on the Reading – 
        Eversley Road. A steam wagon was on the off side of the road facing 
        Eversley for the purpose of taking water from a stream which ran under 
        the road. In reply to the coroner, the officer said that the driver 
        could have taken it on the other side just as well. Marks on the road 
        showed that the car, after striking the wagon, ran along for a distance 
        of 173 feet, mounted the grass verge for 47 feet, regained the road and 
        threw the driver out, after travelling for 38 more feet. Here he found a 
        pool of blood. From here the marks showed that the car went on for 173 
        yards and then ran into the ditch. </span></p>

        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The man was taken to the Royal 
        Berkshire Hospital, Reading. The car was a Morris touring car. Certain 
        proceedings were taken against the driver of the steam wagon for being 
        on that side of the road. The near-side of the rear wing was bent, and 
        the off-side of the car was wrecked.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">In reply to the coroner, witness 
        said that he had never seen wagons taking water from that spot. The 
        wagon had been unloading pipes on that side of the road, about 100 yards 
        down the road.</span></p>

        89 Cholmeley Road, Reading</a></b>,&nbsp; said on November 9<sup>th</sup> 
        he had been carrying water pipes and dropping them on the side of the 
        road as he went along. This caused him to use more water than usual, and 
        at about 4:55 p.m., he stopped to pick up at the spot. As there was 
        insufficient on the near-side, he went over to the off-side to pick up. 
        Witness was standing in front of the engine when he saw a car 
        approaching about 200 yards away. It was driven at a fast pace, and he 
        heard the car hit the wing of the wagon. It then carried on for about 50 
        yards, when the driver fell out. It was between the lights. The side 
        lights of the car were on, but he did not see a head light switched on. 
        He (witness) disagreed with the constable with regard to the quantity of 
        water on the other side of the road. He looked at the stream and decided 
        there would not be enough.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The constable re-called, said on 
        the near-side the stream was joined by two others.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The driver’s brother, <b>Eric 
        Goodey</b> of the same address, also gave evidence. He said he was 
        standing on the grass verge and could see both ways. The car had very 
        poor lights and he estimated the speed at about 35 to 45 miles an hour.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Brain: I suggest to you that 
        you dropped the last lot of pipes on the off-side and then went on the 
        same side and filled with water.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Witness: No.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Witness said the car was on them in 
        an instant.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Brain: Do you mean to tell us 
        that it was only the matter of a moment from the time you saw the car 
        400 yards away, until it passed you?</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Witness: Yes.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Brain: It must have been 
        travelling at a speed.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The jury, after a retirement of 
        nearly half an hour, returned a verdict of “Accidental death” and 
        expressed their opinion that the accident was brought about by an error 
        of judgment on the part of the driver of the car in passing the vehicle. 
        The coroner, jury and Mr. Brain, on behalf of the driver, expressed 
        their sympathy with the relatives.</span></p>

        <p class="stbody">The news item doesn't specify the type of steam wagon,
