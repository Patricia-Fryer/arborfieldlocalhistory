HUNTING IN BERKSHIRE</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">By J. Hautenville Cope.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">(ARTICLE  IX.)</font></b></p>
<p>It may be that some of my readers have missed a few of the previous articles. 
For their benefit I will here briefly repeat events and dates: </p>
<p><b>Sir John Cope</b> took the hounds 1817; in 1843 the country was divided 
and the <b>South Berks Hunt</b> organised, with <b>Mortimer George Thoyts</b> as 
Master. He resigned in 1847, when <b>G. H. Montagu, of Caversham Hill</b>, 
became Master. </p>
<p><b>Sir John Cope</b> gave up his hounds in 1850; at the same time <b>Mr. 
Montagu</b> retired from the mastership of the <b>South Berks</b>, and both 
countries were united under <b>Mr. J. J. Wheble</b>. </p>
<p>In 1852 the united country once more was divided, <b>Mr. Garth</b> taking the 
east side of the River Loddon, the South Berks the other or west side, with <b>
Mr. Wheble</b> as Master.</p>
<p>Now on account of this division comes one of the most important questions – 
that of the boundaries. My father-in-law, the late <b>Major Thoyts</b>, worked 
these out carefully; from his notes I give the boundaries. He had the advantage 
of not only being able to consult the diaries so often mentioned, but also of 
being able to talk the matter over with those whose memories, like his own, went 
back to old times.</p>
<p><i>"It may be interesting"</i>, wrote Major Thoyts, <i>"if I give, as far as 
I am able from old diaries – my father’s, George Montagu’s and my own – the 
outside coverts drawn in successive years. Since the establishment of the South 
Berks Hunt the boundaries between its neighbours, the Craven and the Old 
Berkshire, have not been changed. The alterations are all on the south side of 
the Kennet. </i></p>
<p><i>"In 1843, that is the year the pack was started, Padworth was the western 
limit; next year (1844) Blacknest (Brimpton) was added and the Fir Plantations 
to Mortimer West. </i></p>
<p><i>"In 1847 the country north of the road from Reading to Maidenhead was 
hunted by the South Berks, being lent by Sir John Cope to his neighbours".</i> 
This loan has already been referred to in a previous article. </p>
<p><i>"In 1850, when the South Berks country and Sir John Cope’s country were 
united, and Mr. Wheble became Master, he hunted as far as Mortimer West End, but 
did not hunt Padworth, Aldermaston or Wasing. </i></p>
<p><i>"On April 5<sup>th</sup>, 1853, the South Berks met at Pamber End, 
probably by invitation. </i></p>
<p><i>"Next year, 1854, the boundary appears to have been the road from Pamber 
End to Bramley village; leaving Newlands and Beaurepaire to the left, 
Aldermaston was drawn, but not Wasing. </i></p>
<p><i>"Next season (1855) Paice’s Gulley, Padworth, was drawn; during the season 
1857 the Silchester coverts, as well as the coverts at Brimpton, which belonged 
to the Woolhampton estate. After Christmas of the season 1858-59 the South Berks 
drew the Vine coverts, Swaines, Newlands, Ramsden, to the New Inn, Baughurst, 
also as far as Summerdown and Nutley. This was done on account of the compulsory 
retirement of Mr. Marsh, Master of the Vine. </i></p>
<p><i>"In 1859 Silchester was drawn, as well as the country as far as 
Plantation; in 1861-62 the same arrangement held good. In the following season 
Mr. Pitman did not draw Bramley or Pamber Forest after December 10<sup>th</sup>. 
Mr. Hargreaves became Master in 1863; at what date he began to hunt the Bramley 
and Beaurepaire country I do not know. The South Berks appear to have drawn 
Ladylands for the first time in 1878. </i></p>
<p><i>"In 1887, when Major Allfrey became Master, the Vine reclaimed all their 
country up to Silchester, and the boundary was fixed by agreement with Mr. Beach 
to run along the northern edge of Tadley and Silchester Common to Cooper’s Farm 
at Silchester, crossing the Mortimer and Basingstoke Railway at the ‘Spoil Bank’ 
". </i></p>
<p><i>Since Major Thoyts made these notes the Garth have drawn Ladylands. "The 
Oxfordshire portion seems to have been intermittently hunted; it was drawn 
during the season 1843-44, but not the following season, nor, as far as I can 
find out, till the season 1857".</i></p>
<p>When Mr. Wheble’s country was divided into the South Berks and the Garth 
hunts <b>Robert Tocock</b>, who became huntsman to Mr. Wheble in 1850, left 
Bulmershe to take service as huntsman to Mr. Garth, with whom he remained till 
the end of the season 1864-65, when he retired on a pension, and was succeeded 
by <b>Thomas Sweetman</b>. </p>
<p>In <b>Charles Kingsley’s</b> essay, <b>"My Winter Garden"</b>, which first 
appeared in <b>"Fraser’s Magazine"</b> of January 1858, we read: </p>
<p><i>"That huntsman I have known for fifteen years, and sat many an hour beside 
his father’s death-bed. I am godfather to that whip’s child. I have seen the 
servants of the hunt, as I have the hounds, grow up round me for two 
generations, and I feel for them as old friends, and I like to look into their 
brave, honest, weather-beaten faces." </i></p>
<p>That huntsman was <b>Robert Tocock</b>. His father, <b>Thomas Tocock</b>, had 
been huntsman to <b>Mr. St. John</b>, who started the hunt. When the hounds left
<b>West Court</b> for <b>Bramshill</b> in 1817, the elder Tocock came with the 
pack, and remained as huntsman till 1832, when he resigned. His son, Robert, 
became second whip to <b>Sir John Cope</b>, and as such took part in the great 
run from his old home at <b>Kingston Bagpuise</b>. One day he mentioned this 
event to me, so I have it from his own lips; this was in the season 1828. </p>
<p>The <b>Earl of Kintore</b>, who was then <b>Master of the Old Berkshire</b>, 
invited the Bramshill Hunt to enjoy two separate fortnights’ hunting in the Old 
Berkshire country. The younger Tocock remained some years at Bramshill, became 
first whip, but eventually left to be a hunt servant with <b>Mr. Musters</b>. At 
Bramshill he was succeeded by a man named <b>Thomas Nevard</b>. When Nevard 
left, Robert Tocock returned to his old master, with whom he remained until Sir 
John Cope retired in 1850, when, as already mentioned, he for two seasons 
(1850-52) hunted Mr. Wheble’s hounds. </p>
<p>The Tococks were an old Eversley family, and their names occur in the parish 
registers for some generations, though none of the family now resides in the 
village. Robert Tocock had a brother, who on account of his health was not able 
to become a hunt servant, but in his native parish followed the useful craft of 
a shoe-maker. Amongst his possessions he had something he greatly treasured; one 
of his father’s old hunting horns. "That whip", to whose child Kingsley was 
godfather, was <b>Thomas Sweetman</b>, who succeeded Tocock as huntsman, also 
belonged to an Eversley family; in those old days the village lads as soon as 
they were able entered the service of the squire. He became second whip to Sir 
John Cope, head whip to Mr. Garth, huntsman from 1865, till he died suddenly on 
horseback at the meet at <b>Greywell Hill</b>, the seat of <b>Lord Dorchester</b>, 
in November 1869. He married <b>Anne Strutton</b>, daughter of Sir John Cope’s 
gamekeeper, and was father of two sons, one of whom followed his father’s 
profession; the other is a clerk at the <b>Biscuit Factory, Reading</b>. </p>
<p>After Sweetman’s tragic death Mr. Garth appointed the first whip, <b>Charles 
Brackley</b>, to be huntsman. Brackley began his hunting career in 1852 as 
second horseman to <b>Mr. T. T. Drake</b>, Master of the <b>Bicester</b>. </p>
