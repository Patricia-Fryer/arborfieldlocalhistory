        <p class="stbody">The Cross has become the symbol for the village both 
        because its long association with the Army and because it is placed at 
        the point on the map known for many centuries as 'Arborfield Cross'.&nbsp; 
        It was dedicated in March 1920 by Mrs. Rickman, formerly of Arborfield 
        Grange, who was invited to unveil the memorial, as described in a <b>
        <a href="properties_cross_1920.htm">newspaper article</a></b>. A photo was taken of the occasion:</p>

        <p class="stbody">The setting of the Cross changed over the years as 
        trees were felled and replaced by hedges. </p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" src="images/Memorial_1920s.jpg" width="435" height="595"></p>

        <p class="stbody">The memorial was re-dedicated in 1948 to commemorate 
        those who had fallen in the Second World War, and also to add E. E. 
        Sturges from the First World War. The Sturges family lived at Barkham 
        Square, but were connected by marriage to the Simonds family, and the 
        name was long associated with the Wokingham Rural District Council.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Over the years, the Cross has been battered in road 
        accidents, and had developed a major crack when it was taken down in 
        2004 for the building of the new roundabout. It was moved to the 
        north side of the junction rather than become a target for careless 
        drivers. The crack can be clearly seen in this view from mid-March 2004, 
        a month before it was dismantled.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        The roundabout was completed by September, and the Memorial was 
        relocated on the east edge of the junction, beautifully restored. The 
        roundabout and the surroundings have been carefully landscaped. To see 
        the memorial as it was Remembrance Sunday 2004, click <b>
