</ul>

<p class="stbody"><b><a name="Conroy_1">Sir John Conroy</a>, the 1st Baronet</b>, 
was born on the 21st October 1786 in Wales but was of mainly Irish ancestry, 
claiming descent from the O’Maolconaire family of County Roscommon. He was 
commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1803, retiring on half pay as a Captain 
in 1822. In 1808 he married Elizabeth Fisher, a niece of John Fisher, Bishop of 
Salisbury and sometime tutor to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. Conroy was 
appointed Equerry to the Duke in 1818 on the Duke’s marriage in 1818 to Victoire 
of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, widow of the Prince of Leiningen. The future <b>Queen 
Victoria</b> was the only child of this marriage. She was born in London in 
1819, after a hazardous rush from Germany. This adventure, which was a political 
gesture as two other Royal Duchesses were preparing to be confined in Hanover, 
was organised by Conroy. He arranged for the Duke and Duchess of Kent to break 
their journey at his Shooters Hill house.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The Duke died in 1820 but Conroy remained in the service of 
the Duchess as her principal man of business, and dominated her household 
throughout Queen Victoria’s childhood. Anyone who watched BBC’s 'Victoria and 
Albert' couldn’t help noticing Conroy and his influence. All his children were 
Victoria’s playmates. By the 1830’s Victoria had emerged as Heir Presumptive. 
Conroy’s organisation and the maintaining of public awareness by orchestrating 
provincial tours etc. for the Duchess and Princess was beginning to exasperate 
King William 1V. This was probably instrumental in procuring the Regency Bill, 
which would have made the Duchess Regent if the King had died before Victoria’s 
eighteenth birthday. If this had happened, John Conroy would have been the power 
behind the throne of England for a season. There were rumours that he and the 
Duchess were lovers, but this was never proved.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Aspersions were cast on his financial relations with the 
Duchess of Kent and Princess Sophia; these had enabled him to acquire 
substantial estates at Llanbrynmair (Montgomeryshire) and Arborfield.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">On the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, Conroy’s fortune 
went into reverse, because she openly detested him and his continued presence 
became an irritant to the Queen. He yielded to pressure exerted through the Duke 
of Wellington and after an extended tour abroad, retired to farm and live the 
life of a country gentleman at Arborfield. His expected Irish peerage didn’t 
come to fruition. Instead he received a baronetcy and a pension of £3000 per 
annum. He received numerous Orders from European Royal Houses and an Honorary 
DCL from the University of Oxford.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">As a farmer he was quite an innovator, bringing forward many 
features of modern agriculture, and building what was known as a 'Model Farm'. 
He died on 2nd March 1854. <br>
<br>
Previous to living in <b>Arborfield Hall</b>, he lived in the farm-house, which 
later became the home of his son Edward. They enlarged it and called it <b>
<a href="properties_Arborfield_Cottage.htm">Arborfield Grange</a></b>. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">This portrait was painted by William Ward after William Fowler 
in 1838 or 1839.</p>

<p class="stbody"><a name="Conroy_2">His son</a>, <b>Sir Edward Conroy, the 2nd 
Baronet</b>, found that he could not afford to live at the Hall, so it was put 
up for sale in 1855.&nbsp; He was born on 6th December 1809 in Dublin. After 
education at Charterhouse, and Christ Church, Oxford (where he graduated with a 
pass degree) he went on a European Tour. In 1833 he was engaged briefly as an 
unpaid attaché in the Diplomatic Service in Brussels, and a few years later he 
obtained a position at the London General Register Office. The last gave him a 
taste for genealogy and antiquarian studies; to this he gave critical 
scholarship in matters capable of documentary proof.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The story of his private life runs like a Victorian melodrama. 
In 1837 Lady Alicia Parsons, daughter of the Earl of Rosse, eloped with him from 
London to Gretna Green, where they were married. However, the romance did not 
endure. Soon after the birth of their only child in 1845, they parted, probably 
because Edward Conroy had a roving eye. He had an affair with a 'Mary' in 1847 
and a few years later an 'adopted daughter' appears on the scene, although she 
is believed in fact to be his natural daughter, as she claimed. Shortly before 
his death, he sent his wife a passionate plea for forgiveness and reconciliation 
might have followed, but he died too soon on 3rd November 1869. <br>
&nbsp;</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b><a name="Conroy_3">Sir John Conroy</a>, the 3rd and last 
Baronet</b>, was born at Kensington on 16th August 1845. After Eton, he followed 
his father to Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Natural Science, taking a 
First in 1868: Augustus Vernon Harcourt FRS, the pioneer of chemical kinetics, 
was his tutor. Until 1880 he lived mainly with his mother at Arborfield. He was 
busy with the social round, hunting, etc., but his early scientific work, 
involving some analytical chemistry relating chiefly to optical measurements, 
was undertaken mainly in a laboratory at Christ Church, which he visited for a 
couple of days a week. He held teaching posts at Keble 1880 - 1890, and at 
Balliol and Trinity 1886 - 1900. He was elected a Fellow of Balliol in 1890 and 
FRS in 1891. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">His friendships outside Oxford and science were mainly derived 
from aristocratic contacts made during his undergraduate days at Christ Church. 
He held High Church views taking an active part in the affairs of the English 
Church Union, and served as Treasurer of the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford from 
1897. He never married and died in Rome on 15th December 1900.</p>

<p class="stbody">A newspaper article in February 1930 described the <b>
<a href="families_conroy_chapel.htm">monumental inscriptions in the Conroy 
Chapel</a></b>, which was beginning to decay, and which has long since lost its 
roof, its stained glass window and its monuments.&nbsp; It is useful to compare 
the tone of the article written above with the inscriptions written on the 
monuments. It is interesting to speculate as to why the Conroy family wished to 
maintain a separate chapel in the old church - they didn't seem to get on with 
the <b><a href="families_Hargreaves.htm">Hargreaves</a></b> family, whom they 
considered 'Trade'.</p>
