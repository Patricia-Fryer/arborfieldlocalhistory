        The Museum of English Rural Life has a large set of negatives from the 
        Collier Collection of Arborfield.&nbsp; The Local History Society has 
        purchased copies of them for display at exhibitions. 
        </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        We now have 
        permission to publish these particular images on the web. Click <b>

  <p class="stbody">
        In addition, some of 
        the photographs did find their way into other publications such as the Arborfield Hall Sale documents, which you can see on the Auctions 
        pages., and postcards, which are widely available. Both Nicky Ford's 
        and Martin Shearn's collections include some Collier images that never made their way to the 
        Rural Life Museum collection.

        <b><i>&quot;Phillip Osborne Collier (1881-1979) came to Reading from Windsor 
        late in the 1890's. He began work as a Trainee Electrician at the Royal 
        County Theatre, Friar Street. From 1916-1918 Collier served in the Royal 
        Flying Corps as a cook. During the Second World War Collier became a 
        Special Constable. From the 1920's Collier worked for the Berkshire 
        Chronicle (now the Reading Chronicle), the Reading Standard and the 
        Berkshire Mercury in addition to freelance work. For two periods in the 
        mid 1920's and again in the 1930's Collier worked in partnership with 
        Eric Guy, a Basingstoke Photographer and the partners' work appeared in 
        the magazines Farmer's Weekly and Farmer and Stockbreeder. They worked 
        from premises in Waylen Street, Reading and 106, Oxford Street, Reading. 
        Collier also produced cigarette cards, greetings cards, calendars and 
        scenic real postcards.</i></b></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <b><i>Appraisal - Collier worked prolifically, and seems to have 
        destroyed many of the negatives he created at some time before 1945. 
        Many more were destroyed after his death.</i></b></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <b><i>The Rural History Centre purchased the negatives from Philip 
        Osborne Collier's daughter.&quot;</i></b><br>
&nbsp;</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        This is a rather battered Christmas postcard showing several views from the Collier 
        Collection.&nbsp; It probably sold well among the many domestic staff 
        living in the big houses early in the early 1900's. Scroll across and 
        see several images familiar to those who know the local postcard 
        collections:</p>

        traffic to spoil the stroll;<br>

        is in good condition, with a roof;<br>

        slides showing the <b><a href="pictures_fete_1976.htm">Fete held at the 
        new park on Swallowfield Road in 1976</a></b>. It had been 
open a couple of years, and the trees and shrubs were very sparse compared with 
        today. Because of 
the drought that summer, the grass was like a newly-mown hay-field. </p>
