        I have received a letter from a correspondent at Shinfield from which I 
        quote: “I understand that the Parochial Church Council propose to level 
        the graves in the churchyard of Arborfield Old Church, and ultimately to 
        pull down the chapel to window level on the grounds that it is a 
        dangerous structure. This is a picturesque relic and deserves a better 
        fate than demolition. Can you not bring your influence to bear to arrest 
        this, so that the chapel (the Standen and Conroy mortuary chapel) can be 
        partly restored and the graveyard maintained?”</p>

  <p class="stbody">
        Arborfield, like Hatford in western Berkshire, has two churches - one 
        old and one new, and in both the ruined ones, history is faintly sown. 
        Before the flint and stone building of St. Bartholomew, at Arborfield, 
        was erected - probably in the 13th century - there was a wooden chapel 
        here which had itself become ruinous soon after 1200. In 1222 rumours 
        reached the Dean of Sarum that things were far from satisfactory in that 
        part of his diocese over which the vicar of Sonning had a certain 
        ecclesiastical suzerainty. So the prelate journeyed on a visitation to 
        learn on the spot whether the rumours were founded on fact. They were. 
        He discovered that at Arborfield an old priest from Reading in the house 
        of the manor lord, Richard Bullock, who was serving the chapel, was 
        found not to know a complete word either of the Gospel or the Canon of 
        the Mass. The Bullocks ruled in this corner of the great forest for 
        centuries. One<br>
        was known as “Hugh of the Brazen Hand.” <br>

        <br>
        Adverting to my note of last week, the rector of Arborfield has been 
        good enough to supply me with additional information about what is 
        locally proposed for dealing with the churchyard and the Conroy chapel. 
        The worst vandalism since the last war has been the opening of the 
        vaults in the chapel. These have recently been filled in and permanently 
        sealed. The Parish Council will clear the churchyard and the Parochial 
        Church Council have submitted a revised scheme to the diocesan 
        authorities which will not involve demolition of the chapel, except of 
        such parts of the structure<br>
        as are considered dangerous. The modified scheme is estimated to cost 
        between £129 to £150, to which subscriptions are invited.<br>

        <font size="4">A Sad Story</font><br>
&nbsp;</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The aged clerical custodian of the chapel - one is reminded of Keats’ 
        beadsman in “The Eve of St. Agnes” - was forthwith deprived of his holy 
        office, and the vicar of the mother church of Sonning was called to book 
        for his laxity and indifference. It is a sad story, for the old priest 
        was blind as well as infirm and incompetent, and the swine were wont to 
        wander and grub in the sacred precincts. As to the Standen and Conroy 
        chapel, this was restored and re-roofed by Sir John Conroy about a 
        century ago when the roof of the church itself was taken off, leaving 
        the picturesque ruin we know to-day. A fine Standen altar tomb was 
        removed to the new church. What has transpired here during and since the 
        Second World War is perhaps the reason for my correspondent’s misgiving, 
        for vandalism has been rife; monumental slabs have been torn from the 
        chapel walls; only a part of the roof remains intact; and the churchyard 
        is a veritable jungle. I should perhaps add that as long ago as 1937 a 
        sub-committee of the Berkshire Archaeological Society met members of the 
        Parochial Church Council and offered to support any effort that might be 
        made to raise the sum necessary to preserve the ruined church.<br>

  <p class="stbody">
        Into my temporary possession has come a dilapidated book affording brief 
        but interesting glimpses of Arborfield’s past - the register of baptisms 
        and burials from 1805 until about 1830; kept by an illiterate parish 
        clerk, but bearing the name of the Rev. Henry Hodgkinson - for 42 years 
        rector here, dying 1839 aged 86. How this register came to me I cannot 
        now reveal. It will be returned to the parish charge from which it has 
        strayed; and at a most appropriate time, for this month marks the 
        centenary of Arborfield’s present church of St. Bartholomew.<br>
        <br>
        In this church (transferred from its ruined predecessor near Arborfield 
        Hall) is a memorial to Mr. Hodgkinson and his wife; she died in 1804 in 
        her 29th year, giving birth to a son in the second year of their 
        marriage. What a parish tragedy! We can imagine the sympathy, the 
        condolences, the funeral attended by everybody locally who could attend, 
        from the Squire downwards. The tattered register has an entry concerning 
        “Sarah, wife of Mr. Hennery Hodgkinson. Rector of this parish, Feberary 
        26.”<br>
        <br>
        Another sad record in 1816, when ten-years-old Daniel May -“killed”-was 
        buried. In 1819, “A Streang traveling woman found dead-aged 35.” Thomas 
        Murrell, “a very old man” and his funeral in 1805: I saw reference to 
        nobody over 90, few were elderly, mostly the deaths were of young people 
        and the very young. Among those “borned” and baptised were several 
        love-children, one or two “base-born.” I noted: “Oct. 29, 1815-William 
        s. of William and Mary Ennis-Travellers they said from 
        Salisbury......the child was born in Bare Wood Sept.18th” <br>
        <br>
        In some instances, trades are mentioned - blacksmith, wheelwright, 
        miller, gardener, paper-maker, carpenter - or simply labourer. Names 
        like Corderoy, Brant, Mattingley, Wyndiatt, Pither, Freemantle, 
        Betteridge, Bint, are repeated often, as of families long established. A 
        special flourish as to the baptisms of the son and daughter of John and 
        Mary Simonds, whose family were resident at Newlands for centuries.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

      
  <p class="sthead">
        <font size="4">The ancient bells</font></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <br>
        Still in service at the new church, consecrated in 1863 by Samuel 
        Wilberforce Bishop of Oxford, are the recast ancient bells, two of which 
        date from 1220; bells that have for so long spoken of welcome and 
        farewell, joy and sadness, over the Arborfield countryside. There is 
        stained glass that was made for the old church in the 1780’s by John 
        Rowell, Reading man who kept to his grave the secret of making rich red 
        glass.<br>
        <br>
        The unusual wooden font, carved from the solid and with a pointed cover 
        of oak, has been preserved: so, I understand, has the Victorian 
        hand-organ. Transferred to the new church is the handsome marble and 
        alabaster 17th-century tomb of William Standen and his wife Maria 
        (daughter of the noted Samuel Backhouse of Swallowfield), his effigy 
        recumbent in armour, she is holding a Bible and with at foot a bonneted 
        child.<br>
        <br>
        But there remains only the barest skeleton of the church that, of chalk 
        and flint, arose about 1260; replacing a timber chapel that in 1222 was 
        a tumbled desolation overrun by cattle and pigs, but which had succeeded 
        a Saxon chapel. Doubtless the Bullock family were responsible for these 
        buildings; they were of Saxon origin, and Osmund Bullock, the first 
        recorded in 1190, gave John of Barkham charge. Several of the Bullocks 
        of Arborfield served as sheriffs in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries; 
        one was called, picturesquely, “Hugh with the Brazen Hand.”<br>
&nbsp;</p>

      
  <p class="sthead">
        <br>
        <font size="4">Family in dispute</font></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        When, in the 16th century, Thomas Bullock sold the manor because of 
        debts (owed in part to the queen), the family opposed the sale strongly, 
        his uncle refusing to hand over the title deeds. They forced Thomas to 
        execute a deed of entail - which he later repudiated, proceeding with 
        the sale. Edmund Standen was the purchaser, but left Thomas in rented 
        occupation. William Bullock took the matter to law but was unsuccessful: 
        defying the Star Chamber, and encouraged by his tenants, he entered into 
        illegal possession of Arborfield. For his contempt of court he was sent 
        to the Fleet prison, remaining several years: at last he gave way, 
        returned to Arborfield - where his youngest daughter was born, a happy 
        consolation.<br>
        <br>
        Thomas Bullock, by the way, willed much to his “well-beloved wife” Agnes 
        on condition that she kept herself “sole and unmarried”: she was to have 
        the upper parlour in the manorhouse, the chamber above, the “jake’s 
        chamber” (lavatory) and two butteries, the old dye-house to be her 
        kitchen; should she not want to stay, Barkham Farm was to be hers. <br>
        <br>
        In bad repair, old St. Bartholomew’s had its roof removed in 1863. The 
        walls, when stripped of plaster, were found to have those painted 
        figures and designs that taught parishioners of things religious when 
        books were either beyond them to read or were not available. A faculty 
        was granted for converting the north aisle into two mortuary chapels, by 
        Thomas Hargreaves of Arborfield House, and Sir John Conroy of Arborfield 
        Grange.<br>
        <br>
        Now even these chapels are ruins, only carved armorial bearings, some 
        defaced heads and monumental slabs indicating original purpose. One 
        inscribed slab declares:<br>
        “If God wills, Time cannot destroy us.” <br>
        Well, the church has been devastated by time, but what of the people 
        whose bones lie here? <br>
        <br>
        The Conroy chapel was intended to preserve the memories of those of the 
        family who were “the only members for centuries buried out of Ireland.” 
        A tablet to Sir Edward Conroy, Bt., mentions him as “lineal 
        representative of the chiefs of the native Irish sept of O’Maolconroy, 
        Co. Roscommon in the Province of Connaught”: he married a daughter of 
        the Earl of Rosse. Another tribute is to Elizabeth wife of Sir John 
        Conroy, only child and heir of Major-General Fisher of the Royal 
        Engineers, “born 1791 in the Government House in Quebec.....and married 
        by special licence in Dublin Dec. 8. 1808.” bearing six children to him 
        and dying in 1861.<br>
        <br>
        Yet another tells us that in the family vault in the churchyard rest the 
        remains of Sir John Conroy, Kt. and Bt., who, born in 1786 in 
        Caernarvonshire, died at Arborfield Hall in 1851. He was “created a 
        Knight Commander of Hanover by George IV and received many other 
        distinguished honours for his long and faithful services to their royal 
        highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Kent, and to the Princess Victoria, 
        who on her accession to the throne created him a peer of Ireland as soon 
        as the state of the peerage of that kingdom would permit.” The tablet 
        was erected by his wife and family.<br>
        <br>
        This Sir John was one who, had his ambitions been realised, would have 
        ruled the country as joint Regent for a time. Equerry to the Duke of 
        Kent, when the duke died he became comptroller of the duchess’s 
        household: his daughter Victoire was one of the few children allowed to 
        play with the young Princess Victoria at Kensington Palace.<br>
        <br>
        Conroy, conceited and ambitious, offended William IV by his attitude as 
        “a kind of prime minister” who joined with the duchess in a plot to 
        force upon Victoria an extension of the Regency and acceptance of Sir 
        John as her private secretary. But Victoria was hostile to the plan, 
        detesting Conroy: King William lived until she attained her majority, 
        much to his personal gratification: as queen, she pensioned off Conroy 
        with £3,000 a year and a baronetcy - but refused him an Irish peerage. 
        Released from the influence of the man alleged to have been her lover, 
        the duchess became a changed and better person. The disappointed Sir 
        John died at Arborfield.<br>
