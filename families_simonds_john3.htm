<p class="stbody">John Simonds, the third in the same line to have this name, 
died in 1929. You will find references to him throughout this web site, because 
he was involved in so many of the village's organisations. His wife was the 
daughter of the Rector John Hayes, and his own son had 'Hayes' as his middle 
name.</p>

<p align="center" class="stbody"><b>DEATH OF MR JOHN SIMONDS</b></p>
<p align="center" class="stbody"><b>Honorary Freeman of Reading</b></p>
<p align="center" class="stbody"><b>A GREAT FAMILY OF BANKERS</b></p>
<p class="stbody">It is with the deepest regret that we have to record the death 
of Mr. John Simonds, a freeman of Reading, which occurred suddenly at his 
residence, Newlands, Arborfield, on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p class="stbody">The late Mr. Simonds, who was 83 years of age, was the third 
generation to bear the Christian name of John, his father and grandfather also 
bearing that name. He had lived all his life in Berkshire, where he was one of 
the best-known and most popular figures, and he was held in the highest esteem 
by all with whom he came into contact. His passing will mean the loss of a great 
friend to many, and his death will be regretted by all who knew him.</p>
<p class="stbody">The late Mr. John Simonds was a local director of Barclays 
Bank, and was formerly the senior partner of Messrs. J. and C. Simonds and Co., 
a firm whose banking connection with Reading dates back to 1791, when a firm was 
started by Robert Micklem, John Stephens, William Blackall Simonds, and Robert 
Harris. From 1816 onwards the partners in the bank were all members of the 
Simonds family.</p>
<p class="stbody">In 1859 various changes caused by death had left the late Mr. 
John Simonds’ father the sole partner, and in 1871 he took his two sons, Mr. 
John Simonds (the third) and Mr. William Simonds, and his nephew Mr. James 
Simonds, into partnership, and until 1905 these three controlled the business. 
In that year the death of Mr. James Simonds resulted in the final change of 
partners before the amalgamation with Barclays Bank, Ltd., in 1913, Mr. Charles 
Francis Simonds, son of Mr. James Simonds, Mr. John Hayes Simonds and Mr. Gerald 
Pomeroy Simonds, the sons of the surviving partners, being taken into 
partnership.</p>
<p class="stbody">
<img border="0" alt="William and John Simonds" src ="images/simonds1.jpg" width=524 height=597 ></p>
<p class="stbody">On the amalgamation the late Mr. John Simonds, Mr. William 
Simonds (who died a short while ago), and Mr. John Hayes Simonds, of the old 
partnership, and Mr. Maurice Hayes Simonds, a son of Mr. John Simonds, became 
local directors. Mr. John Hayes Simonds was appointed a director of Barclays 
Bank, Ltd., in 1923.</p>
<b>
<p class="stbody">Splendid Services to Reading</p>
</b>
<p class="stbody">The late Mr. John Simonds had an official connection with the 
Borough of Reading which extended for close upon 60 years. On April 25<sup>th</sup>, 
1870, he was appointed by the local Board of Health for the borough as 
treasurer, and on September 16<sup>th</sup>, 1872, the Reading Town Council 
appointed him to act as treasurer under the Sanitary Acts. On October 24<sup>th</sup> 
1901, the Town Council chose him as borough treasurer in the place of Mr. 
Charles Stephens, and he held this position right up to the time of his death. 
His connection with the borough was of vital importance, particularly in the 
matter of the raising of loans. Never once did the firm of J. and C. Simonds 
refuse the amount required by the Corporation to meet pressing financial 
obligations or to carry out public works.</p>
<p class="stbody">The Reading Council honoured him in July, 1924, by conferring 
on him the honorary freedom of the Borough, and no man more worthily deserved 
the honour. The conferring of such an honour was a rare occasion indeed in 
Reading, and only ten people have received it. Of these, only two are now alive 
– the Marquis of Reading and the Rt. Hon. Leslie Wilson.</p>
<p class="stbody">For 25 years the late Mr. John Simonds served in the Berkshire 
Volunteers, retiring in 1891 with the rank of Lieut.-Col. He was the possessor 
of the Long Service Medal. In 1866 he went as a representative volunteer under 
Col. Loyd Lindsay to a great gathering at the "Tir Nationale" in Brussels.</p>
<b>
<p class="stbody">A Great Sportsman</p>
</b>
<p class="stbody">The principal recreation enjoyed by the late Mr. Simonds was 
hunting, and he was never happier than when he was astride a good horse, 
enjoying a gallop behind the pack. The success of the Garth hounds was due to a 
very large extent to the most satisfactory manner in which he carried out the 
secretarial duties during a period of 35 years. He endeared himself so much to 
the followers of the pack that he was elected their president.</p>
<p class="stbody">In addition to being treasurer to the Reading Town Council, 
Mr. Simonds held a similar position to the Reading Board of Guardians, and to 
other public bodies and institutions. He had acted as hon. treasurer to the 
Reading Alexandra Rose Day, and when the National Playing Fields movement was 
started, he at once lent his support by accepting the position of hon. treasurer 
to the Berkshire Association.</p>
<p class="stbody">Mr. Simonds was keenly interested in all subjects affecting 
the countryside. He showed this interest by continued support for Wokingham and 
District Agricultural Association, of which he occupied the presidential chair 
in 1925, when the society’s show was held at Arborfield. Mr. Simonds also served 
on the local committee on the occasion of the visit of the Royal Show to Reading 
in 1926.</p>
<p class="stbody">A life-long Conservative, Mr. John Simonds was a 
vice-president of the Reading Conservative and Unionist Association.</p>
<b>
<p class="stbody">Generosity to Arborfield</p>
</b>
<p class="stbody">The late Mr. Simonds had lived in the Arborfield district 
practically all his life, and his generosity in the district was unbounded. The 
villagers of Arborfield have lost a true friend by his death. He was an 
attendant at Arborfield Church. Among local positions held by him was the 
presidency of the Arborfield Cricket Club, whose ground was lent by him to the 
club. He took an interest in everything that was for the welfare of the 
locality.</p>

<p class="stbody">Mr. John Simonds married a daughter of the <b>
<a href="families_hayes.htm">Rev. Sir John 
Warren Hayes</a></b>. <b><a href="families_ellen_simonds.htm">Mrs. Simonds</a></b> died many years ago. He leaves two sons and five 
daughters. The two sons are both engaged in banking. Mr John Hayes Simonds is a 
director of Barclays Bank and also a local director, and Major Maurice Hayes 
Simonds is a local director of the bank at Reading and Windsor. The greatest 
sympathy will be felt for the family.</p>
<p class="stbody">The funeral will take place at Arborfield to-day (Sat.) at 
2.30 p.m. At the same time a memorial service will be held at St. Laurence’s 
Church, Reading.</p>
