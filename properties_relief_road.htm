        <p align="left">Although there had been rumours that 
      the Army would vacate its site at Arborfield dating back to <strong><a 
      href="C20/memories_Remount_Depot_Closure.htm">1937 when the Remount Depot 
      closed</a></strong>, in fact the Army presence expanded in 1938 when the 
      mechanised <strong>RAOC Depot</strong> moved to the new Arborfield 
      Garrison, followed by the <strong><a 
      href="C20/memories_Army_Tech_School_1939.htm">Army Technical School in 
      1939</a></strong>. The Second World War and the increasing demands for 
      technical skills led to the formation of the Royal Electrical and 
      Mechanical Engineers (REME) in 1942, and the siting of several barracks at 
      the Garrison. The Army Technical School later became the Army Apprentices' 
      College, among other names; it eventually closed in 2004, leaving the 
      <strong>School of Electronic and Aeronautic Engineering (SEAE)</strong>
          
                   
                    
                    
        .</p>      

        <p align="left">The Ministry of Defence had been 
      planning to merge all of its more advanced technical training onto one 
      site covering the Army, the Navy and Royal Air Force for some years, and 
      after several false starts, a <strong><a 
      href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-22888739">planning 
      application was submitted to convert the former RAF base at Lyneham, 
      Wiltshire, in June 2013</a></strong>
          
                   
                    
                    
        .</p>      

        <p align="left">The area around the Garrison&nbsp;had 
      been identified as a possible large housing development&nbsp;by 
      <strong>Wokingham Borough Council</strong>, and it was thought that if 
      3,500 dwellings were to be concentrated in one&nbsp;<strong>'Strategic 
      Development Location'</strong>, then this would pay for the infrastructure 
      needed to support it. In 2005 it was proposed to build a bypass well to 
      the west of Arborfield, crossing over fields near&nbsp;<strong>Bartletts 
      and Whites Farms</strong>     
               
                   
              
                   
                  on 
      Swallowfield Road, and then to cross the River Loddon and 
      meet&nbsp;another bypass in Shinfield.The cost&nbsp;proved to be too high 
      for even 3,500 houses to finance, and Wokingham Borough Council finally announced 
      its 'technical recommendation' in July
          
                   
                    
               2013 for a more modest 
        scheme.</p>      

        <p align="left">A <strong>packed meeting at</strong> 
      <strong>Henry Street Garden Centre on July 15th 2013</strong>       
           was surprised to hear that the recommended route 
      was much closer to Arborfield Cross than had been expected. In fact, for 
      most of its route it was to follow the line of a bypass originally planned 
      in January 1945&nbsp; [Berkshire Record Office reference C/CL/C3/21/1] but 
      dropped in the late 1960s, by which time the settlement boundary&nbsp;of 
      Arborfield Cross had almost
          
                   
                    
               reached the line of this 
        route.</p>      

        <p align="left">This article explores the land to the 
      west of Arborfield Cross that would

            the sub-station had never been used, and that the cable was deemed 
            to be redundant. It had been intended to serve a small housing
