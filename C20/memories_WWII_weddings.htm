The local newspapers were very restricted in column space during World War 2, 
but throughout the conflict, they often managed to find space to celebrate the 
weddings of local residents, usually with small photographs.<p>Bearing in mind 
that Arborfield Church's Marriage Register was stolen in the mid-1970s, we don't 
have a record of 20th Century marriages up to that time. It is therefore 
appropriate that we give space to news of these weddings and announcements from 
the local newspapers. Most of the articles are from the 'Reading Mercury', but a 
few are from the 'Times and Weekly News' as indicated. </p>
