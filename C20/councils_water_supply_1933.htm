      <p align="center"><strong>New Pumping Station opened at 
      Arborfield.</strong></p>
      <p align="center"><strong>340 FEET BOREHOLE.</strong></p>
      <p align="center"><strong>A Copious Supply “of Excellent 
      Quality”.</strong></p>
      <p>The culmination of years of work on the part of 
      the<strong> Wokingham Rural District Council</strong> was marked on 
      Wednesday, when the chairman (<strong>Mr. E. M. Sturges</strong>) formally 
      opened the <strong>Arborfield Mill Pumping Station</strong>             
                  
             .</p>
      <p>The water supply for the central part of the Council's district has 
      been a matter of considerable trouble, but it is hoped that now all that 
      trouble is over. The water, which has been described by an analyst as 
      “typical well water of excellent quality”, is obtained from a borehole 340 
      feet deep.</p>
      <p>During a fourteen days' test the yield was never less than a 
      quarter-of-a-million gallons a day, and the reservoir which has been 
      erected will hold twice this quantity, so that there is no danger of a 
      shortage.</p>
      <p>The residents of the district are now assured of a pure and copious 
      water supply and the present works are of such a nature as to need little 
      adjustment to meet any new local demand.</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>QUARTER OF A MILLION GALLONS A DAY.</strong></p>
      <p>The pumping station is housed in what was at one time a grist mill on 
      land belonging to Arborfield Hall, the residence of Mr. and Mrs. G. 
      Allsebrook.</p>

               <b>Also present</b> were <b>Mr. and 
      Mrs. G. Allsebrook</b>, <b>Miss Allsebrook</b> and <b>Mr. Colin Allsebrook</b>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sturges, before opening the station, said he 
      spent many hours of his life at the work. He was very pleased to see there 
      that day <strong>Mr. Treacher</strong>, who knows more about the inside of 
      the earth than any other man in England. He was sorry <strong>Mr. George 
      Ford</strong> (the vice-chairman of the R.D.C.) was unable to be present. 
      <strong>Mr. Fitzwarren Smith</strong> had also gone to a great deal of 
      trouble to help them in every possible way, and they regretted his 
      absence. Mr. Sturges paid a tribute to the work done by the clerk of the 
      Council, <strong>Mr. P. H. Phipps</strong>            
                     
                    
                   
                    
                    
                     
          .</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>38 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE.</strong></p>
      <p>Mr. Sturges recalled that he was elected to the Council thirty-eight 
      years ago, and after he had been a member for about five months, he was 
      made vice-chairman. He held that office for eight years, and for thirty 
      years he had been chairman. They had had a great deal of trouble and many 
      trials. The water scheme had been a great trouble. Eventually, after other 
      schemes had been considered, they came to terms with Mr. Allsebrook. All 
      he could say about it was that it would be a great blessing in their 
      neighbourhood. They must not be angry, however, if at first the water was 
      a little discoloured, because it would be passing through new pipes. </p>
      <p>Mr. Sturges then proceeded inside the station and severed a ribbon tied 
      to the valves. After this he was presented with a well-bucket as a memento 
      of the occasion, and Mrs. Sturges was presented with a bouquet by Miss 
      Allsebrook.</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKS.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Mr. J. S. Alford</strong>   , M. Inst. C.E., the engineer, spoke and said the water 
      supply of the central part of the rural district had been a troublesome 
      matter for many years, but that day the troubles might be regarded as 
      over.</p>
      <p>The works are laid out so as to distribute 250,000 gallons a day, which 
      is considered more than the demand is likely to be for many years to 
      come”, he said. “When the borehole was put down it was tested by 14 days' 
      continuous pumping, and during that time it never yielded less than 
      250,000 gallons a day. Tests of this character are carried out for two 
      reasons. First, to ascertain whether the yield is reliable, and secondly, 
      to enable a sample to be taken after a prolonged period of pumping, at 
      which time if there are any impurities in the ground from which the water 
      comes they are likely to be drawn into the borehole. </p>
      <p>A sample was taken, and the chemist who analysed it described it as a 
      'typical well water of excellent quality'. This water, which is the result 
      of rainfall on the Hampshire Downs, has before reaching the borehole 
      passed through miles of chalk and may be regarded as safe against impurity 
      as any water possibly can be. None of the water which falls on the area 
      supplied is allowed to get into the borehole. Such water is excluded by 
      means of a steel lining which has been carried to 224 feet below the 
      surface. The top of the chalk is about 200 feet below the surface at this 
      place. The borehole is 340 feet deep altogether.</p>
      <p>“What may be described as the backbone of the 
      scheme consists in a main laid from <strong>Arborfield Mill</strong>, 
      through <strong>Arborfield Cross</strong> and <strong>Barkham</strong>, to 
      the new service reservoir on <strong>Bear Wood</strong>. This reservoir 
      will hold 500,000 gallons and is in three parts, of which only one part is 
      needed at present. From the reservoir the supply main continues through 
      Sindlesham to <strong>Winnersh cross-roads</strong> and thence to 
      <strong>Loddon Bridge</strong>              
                 
                 
                    
                
             . These mains are 
      10in., 9in., and 8in. in diameter. From this backbone, branches of smaller 
      diameter have been laid to the more populous areas. The total length of 
      mains laid is about 25 miles. Of this the backbone represents about 6¼ 
      miles.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>“The cost of the scheme has been about £50,000. 
      There is still some work to do, chiefly in the <strong>parish of 
      Earley</strong>             
              . The cost of it depends on the 
      result of negotiations not completed. The ultimate cost of the scheme will 
      exceed £50,000, but not by any large amount.</p>
      <p>“If”, he continued, “at some future time the demand should exceed 
      250,000 gallons a day, or if a new heavy local demand should arise where 
      it is not expected, the adjustments and new works necessary to increase 
      the quantity would not be serious. There will be no difficulty in 
      constructing a high level tank at Bear Wood to work in conjunction with 
      the reservoir recently constructed, so giving a greater head during the 
      hours when the demand is greatest and consequently when the pressure is 
      lowest. For this purpose the additional height to which it will be 
      necessary to pump the water could be arranged without difficulty.</p>
      <p><a href="../properties_OS_Map.htm"><img border="1" hspace="0" 
      alt="The pump and reservoirs from old OS 1-inch map" 
      src ="../images/new/OS_water_main.jpg" width=691 height=384 ></a>           
      </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>KEEPING THE RATE DOWN.</strong></p>
      <p>“In laying out the scheme we have been governed throughout by the 
      consideration that for many years to come the revenue from water rents 
      cannot meet the loan charged, and that the difference will necessitate a 
      rate in aid. To keep down the rate as low as possible the capital cost 
      must be as small as is consistent with providing a suitable and sufficient 
      supply. This object has been kept in view throughout. The council have 
      been able to carry out the scheme at a time of low prices and when 
      substantial help could be obtained by a grant from the Unemployment Grants 
      Committee. It would, therefore, appear that the delay which occurred in 
      launching the scheme has not been without its advantages.</p>
      <p>“The scheme provides an ample supply of pure and wholesome water 
      obtained under the district, pumped by water power available in the 
      district, and stored in a service reservoir in the district. It is 
      therefore in every way a self-contained district scheme.”</p>
      <p>Concluding, he took the opportunity of congratulating Mr. Sturges on 
      the completion of the scheme, on which, during his long term as chairman 
      of the council, he has spent so much thought and time. He also spoke 
      highly of the work of the contractors, Messrs. George Riley and Co., and 
      Messrs. Collier and Catley.</p>
      <p>Mr. Allsebrook was thanked for his services, and Dr. Paterson also 
      spoke. He said he regarded it as a great day, because he looked on a pure, 
      wholesome and copious water supply as the foundation stone of the 
      structure of public health.</p>
      <p>Mr. Allsebrook mentioned the geological features 
      affecting the scheme, and said that there were only fourteen degrees of 
      hardness in the water.<a href="../pictures_collier_A790.htm">

           Allsebrook.</p>
      <p>The stand-by pump was made by the Pulsometer Enginering Co., and the 
      crude oil engine by Petters of Yeovil. The turbine was supplied by Boving, 
      and the large ram pumps by Hayward, Tyler and Co. Considerable work below 
      the surface and below river level was necessitated to instal this plant, 
      and it was carried out by Messrs. Collier and Catley.</p>

      SUPPLY.</font></strong></p>
      <p>Wednesday was a proud day for Mr. E. M. Sturges, the chairman of the 
      Wokingham Rural District Council, for it marked the formal opening of the 
      Arborfield Mill Pumping Station in conjunction with the provision of a 
      water supply for the central part of the Council's district. No-one has 
      displayed greater enthusiasm for the scheme than Mr. Sturges, and it must 
      be a matter of keen satisfaction to him that, considering the enormous 
      difficulties which have been surmounted, it has at last been brought to 
      fruition. </p>
      <p>Mr. Sturges has been associated with the council for 38 years, for 30 
      years of which he has been chairman, and it is particularly appropriate 
      that he should have been asked to open the new pumping station. The scheme 
      is an excellent one for the district, and it should do much for its 
      development. The total length of main is about 25 miles, and the cost of 
      the scheme has been about £50,000. </p>
      <p>In giving a description of the works, the engineer pointed out that the 
      water supply of the central part of the rural district had been a 
      troublesome matter for many years, but now the trouble might be described 
      as over. What might be described as the backbone of the scheme, he said, 
      consisted in a main laid down from Arborfield Mill through Arborfield 
      Cross and Barkham to the new service reservoir at Bear Wood. From the 
      reservoir the supply main continues through Sindlesham and Winnersh Cross 
      Roads and thence to Loddon Bridge. </p>
      <p>One of the chief difficulties has been that for many years the revenue 
      from water rents will be insufficient to meet the loan charges and that a 
      rate in aid is inevitable. To keep down this rate as low as possible while 
      securing a sufficient supply has given rise to anxious consideration. 
      Everyone concerned in this important piece of public work may certainly be 
      congratulated on its successful accomplishment.</p>
