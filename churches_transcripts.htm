  <p class="stbody">
        Up to 1837, <b>St. Bartholomew's Arborfield</b> was part of the <b>
        Diocese of Salisbury</b>, after which it and other Berkshire parishes 
        were transferred to the <b>Diocese of Oxford</b>. A second copy of the 
        Parish Registers was always lodged with the Diocesan Bishop, and it must 
        have been a complex business getting these Transcripts to the Bishop 
        before the days of stage-coaches, let alone trains. </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        <b>Bishop's Transcripts</b> prior to 1700 have been available since the 
        1980's in printed form at the <b>Berkshire Record Office</b>. One set is 
        in chronological order, while the other has been separated into 
        Baptisms, Marriages and Burials. However, until now the Transcripts 
        between the early 1700's and 1837 have only been available in their 
        original form. They are held at the <b>Wiltshire and Swindon Record 
        Office</b>.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Arborfield Local History Society has now made a careful comparison of 
        the Baptism, Marriage and Burial Registers between 1700 and 1837 against 
        the Bishop's Transcripts, and the combined result is now obtainable 
		<strong><a href="Registers/Registers.htm">on this web-site</a></strong>. </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        It's amazing how many entries appeared on the Transcripts but were not 
        on the main Registers. Also there was often additional information on 
        the Transcripts, usually the place of residence. This is important for 
        Arborfield Parish, because so many of those who attended church were 
        from the <b>Liberty of Newland</b>, which was part of the <b>parish of 
        Hurst</b>.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The Transcripts originally consisted of a single sheet of parchment, 
        listing the Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, sometimes on both sides of 
        the sheet. It appears that the Transcripts tended to be assembled first, 
        and then the entries were placed in the main Registers afterwards, 
        because in some cases the entries on the back of the Transcript sheet 
        never made it to the registers.</p>

  <p class="stbody">
        Some of the Transcripts give us an idea of how they were passed to the 
        Bishop. The Dean of the Cathedral would make a <b>'Visitation'</b> to 
        the local area for a couple of days. In Arborfield's case, all the 
        Parish clergy and Churchwardens would travel to <b>Sonning</b> to meet 
        the Dean, as revealed in these page headings:</p>

      
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">"A copy of the Register of the 
  Parish of Arborfield in the County of Berks for the year 1713 delivered in at 
  the Visitation Court held at Sunning, Apr: 24 1714 by the Revd. Dean of Sarum."</span></i></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">"A copy of the Arborfield 
  Register for the year 1714 delivered in at the Visitation Court held at 
  Sunning, Berks, May 2<sup>nd</sup> 1715."</span></i></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">"A copy of the Register of 
  Arborfield in the County of Berks from Lady Day 1723 to Lady Day 1724".</span></i></b></p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Sometimes, there wouldn't be a Visitation in a given year, and so the 
        Transcripts covered two years&nbsp; (1777/8 and 1795/6), and sometimes 
        even three (1766/68). Some, such as that for 1741, stated 'No 
        Marriages', so at least we have confirmation that there were no missing 
        entries for that year.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        By 1813, the Registers were in pre-printed books; however, the 
        Transcripts were simply written on the pre-printed pages, which were 
        detached or even cut out, and taken in a bundle to the Dean. If there 
        were two Marriages, one would be written on one side and the other on 
        the reverse. </p>

      
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Here's a summary of the missing or 
  variant data on the Bishop's Transcripts over this period: </span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Baptisms 1700-1837</b>: total 
    1598; 47 had additional data; 46 had significant differences; and there were 
    40 extra entries that didn't appear on the original Registers.</span></p>
    <li>
    <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Marriages 1700-1837</b>: total 
    260; 17 had additional data; 14 had significant differences; and 21 were 
    extra entries not on the original Registers.</span></p>
    <li>
    <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Burials 1700-1837</b>: total 891;

  </ul>

      
    <p class="stbody">
        The Transcripts fill in our knowledge about the Churchwardens (several
        <b>Allwrights</b> and <b>Simonds</b> were listed) and in some cases we 
        learn about the Curates, such as <b>Rev. Dr. William Romaine</b> in 
        1813, and <b>Rev. George Hulme</b> in 1818. The full list of signatories 
        appears <strong><a href="Registers/Churchwardens.htm">here</a></strong>. Here's an example of the signatures; this 
    example is at the bottom of the Transcript for 1718:<p class="MsoNormal">
