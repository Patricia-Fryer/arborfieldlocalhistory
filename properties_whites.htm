        Bartlett's Farmhouse on  <br>

        Swallowfield Road. Both were owned by the 
        Swallowfield Park Estate. The barn <br>

        seen in this 1994 photograph has now been converted 
        into a separate dwelling.</p>

        <p class="stbody">By 1963, when the following aerial photo was taken, 
        White's and Bartlett's Farms <br>

        were operated as one unit. White's is on the left. In 
        the 1990's, the barn at White's <br>

        Farm was converted into a dwelling, and it has now 
        been extended into an 'L' shape.</p>

        <p class="sthead">THE GHOST OF WHITE’S FARM</p>

        <p class="stbody">According to legend, this farm was once haunted by the 
        ghost of <br>

        the farmer’s wife. She lived in the 18th century, and 
        was thought <br>

        hereabouts to be a witch. Soon after she died several 
        local people <br>

        claimed to have seen a prowling figure, wringing its hands and <br>

        groaning, nearby, on the dark, lonely stretch of road. The ghostly <br>

        figure would then

        disappear into a pond by the roadside. </p>

        <p class="stbody">Such was the disquiet caused by this phenomenon that 
        seven <br>

        clergymen were called upon to keep vigil. When the ghostly figure <br>

        next arose from the depths, they began to chant in unison and <br>

        continued to do so until the figure once again descended into the <br>

        deep, murky waters of the pond. At this point the frightened villagers <br>

        lowered a huge, flat stone into the pond,

        exactly where the figure&nbsp; <br>

        had last been seen. The appearance of the ghost on the road then ceased.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Time passed, and about one hundred years later some 
        labourers <br>

        were directed to clean out the old pond. This they did and during <br>

        their labours discovered a large, flat stone right at the bottom of the <br>

        pond. They, unaware of the old story, were about to remove it, when <br>

        their foreman, undoubtedly a local, insisted that they leave the stone <br>

        exactly where they had found it. This

        they did.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In the 20th century, the pond was finally filled in, 
        with the stone left <br>

        undisturbed. Long may it remain so! </p>
