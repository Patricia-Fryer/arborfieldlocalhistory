<p align="center"><b>MR. E. A. RECORD OF ARBORFIELD</b></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>The Government White Paper on Small Farmers (with big capital letters) 
suggests a</font><font size="1"> </font><font size="2">man such as <b>Mr. E. A. 
Record, of Targetts Farm, Arborfield</b>, as 
      a typical example of this much-talked-of section of the agricultural 
      community. The main scheme of the Whitehall proposals for assisting small 
      farmers undertakes to provide finance to improve the earning capacity of 
      farming businesses between 20 and 100 acres, so long as they also satisfy 
      an economic test.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Ernest Atkin Record - usually known as Tony" vspace="5" align="left" src="../images/new/tony_record.jpg" width="234" height="309"><b>Ernest 
Atkin Record</b> - Tony to his family and others - is one of the thousand or so 
farmers in Berkshire who live on 5-50 acres, and he is one of those small 
producers who rely on milk, pigs and eggs - the products which have borne the 
main impact of the cost/price squeeze at successive price reviews. With his 35 
acres he is the smallest farmer so far to take his place in this series, 
contrasting with, at the other extreme, Rex Paterson, who farms a total of 8,000 
acres. </p>
<p>When, almost three years ago, the Berks A.E.C. walked Targetts Farm, with 
fodder production in mind, the holding was but 28 acres; since then another few 
acres have been bought by the landlord, and that inclusion has meant for the 
tenant a simplification of an extremely awkward lay-out; it has made, roughly 
speaking, a rectangle out of a geometrical pattern that would have foxed Euclid.</p>
<p>This is no case of ‘farming in the blood’. Young Tony Record had an office 
job originally, then came the war and service in the Royal Air Force, and a long 
spell as a prisoner-of-war. When uniform was eventually cast off, the problem of 
what to do resolved itself in the decision (as in so many other instances) to go 
on the land, as a healthy and satisfying alternative to an office stool. </p>
<p>After a period of apprenticeship on Dean's <b>Farm, Caversham</b>, he took on 
five little acres at Woodcote and came to Targetts' then 28 acres, about five 
years ago. It was all grass and, except for one field, of low quality. With the 
plough and fertilisers, productive leys were brought into being, enabling more 
stock to be kept.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of N.A.A.S.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> </font>
<font size="2">advice and Government grants (particularly in respect of an £80 
concrete silage apron) Tony Record has shown what the little man can do with a 
little encouragement. The wet nature of the land has been – and still is - a 
problem, but an ambitious drainage scheme is being planned (with the prospect of 
a grant) and, when completed, gum boots should be a little less necessary. A 
ditch of about 60 chains long is, one gathers, contemplated. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Overgrown hedges are being drastically trimmed (with due 
respect for good specimens of hedgerow timber) and the additional light and air 
should reduce wasteful headlands for which there is no room on a farm of this 
size.</p>
<p>Guernseys were the cattle here but they are being replaced by Ayrshires, a 
breed which it is now thought will be more suited to the land than the Channel 
Islanders. A.I. is used, and Angus semen is also called for with a view to beef 
calves. Landrace and Landrace crosses produce baconers, and there are about 200 
poultry on deep litter, eggs being sold at the farm gate. </p>
<p>Milk, bacon and eggs - plus a certain amount of contract work - are not 
making a fortune for the tenant of Targetts Farm but they represent an economic 
proposition. It's hard work, of course. The only help is that of 16-years-old <b>
Michael Brown</b>, a village boy who is a reliable and steady worker. For the 
boss it’s a job that knows no hours, a job in which the working week consists of 
seven days.</p></font>
