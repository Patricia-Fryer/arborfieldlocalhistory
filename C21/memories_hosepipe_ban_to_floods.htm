        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">2012 began with a drought that had continued for a 
      couple of years, and from the start everything seemed topsy-turvy. The 
      dawn chorus could be heard in early January, and some daffodils bloomed by 
      the end of the month. Oak trees were in leaf more than a month early, and 
      a hose-pipe ban had to be introduced&nbsp;on 5th April. The River 
      Kennet&nbsp;had been reduced to a trickle in parts, and navigation was 
      severely restricted on the Kennet and Avon Canal. Then it started to 
      rain....</font></p>      

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">The 
      following photographs document the delightful countryside around 
      Arborfield from January to May 2012, and give some idea of what it's like 
      to explore the&nbsp;unrivalled network of footpaths radiating from the 
      centre. Photos can't capture the sheer variety of birdsong that dominates 
      some areas like the Coombes, around the centuries-old Kenney's 
      Farmhouse&nbsp;or&nbsp;the cacophony of crows and rooks at Arborfield 
      Grange, so it's worth an early morning walk to experience it for yourself.

      share, please let us know.</font></p>
