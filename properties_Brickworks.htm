        Ordnance Survey map of Arborfield shows the location of the old 
        brickfield, south-east of Duck's Nest Farm.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">Even earlier, there was a brick 
        kiln in Arborfield Parish at <b><a href="properties_elishas.htm">
        Elisha's Farm</a></b> ; the triangle of woodland between the new church 
        building and Reading Room Cottage is known as '<b>Brick Kiln Coppice</b>'. 
        In the 1841 Census (over 20 years before the church was built), 
        25-year-old <b>William Barker</b> was a '<b>Brickmaker</b>', living at '<b>Brick 
        Kiln</b>'. It was probably in Church Lane, though we don't have quite 
        enough information to locate this. Was William Barker an ancestor of the
        <b>Barker Brothers</b>? That same year, 13-year-old <b>John Giles</b> 
        was a '<b>Journeyman Brickmaker</b>' lodging at 'Arborfield House 
        Stables'. </span></p>

        <font size="4">BARKER TYPE 
        BRICKS GO BACK TO THE ROMANS</font></span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As industry moves into the 
        computer age and becomes more and more mechanised, it’s reassuring to 
        learn that there are still some crafts that a skilled worker can do 
        better than a machine.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The <b>Whitehall Brick and Tile 
        Works</b> at Arborfield turns out about 30,000 hand-made bricks each 
        week using a system which has not changed in its principle since Roman 
        times.
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Oliver and Arthur Bishop at Whitehall Brick and Tile Works" vspace  =5 align=right src="images/new/oliver_and_arthur_barker.jpg" width=355 height=444 ></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The firm was started in 1934 by 
        two brothers, <b>Arthur (6</b><b>5)</b> and <b>Oliver (63) Barker</b>. 
        Before this, they had worked for their father, who was manager at the 
        former <b>Toutley brickworks at Wokingham</b>. He retired, but his 
        knowledge and experience proved invaluable to his sons. He, in turn, had 
        had his father and grandfather to call on, as they were also in the 
        trade.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Because theirs is an old trade, 
        it doesn’t mean they are unaware of modern business methods. Some years 
        ago, in keeping with the trend, they called in some time and motion 
        experts. They suggested that magical formula which all time and motion 
        experts adhere to – ‘mechanise’.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So, at great expense, the 
        brothers bought two moulding machines, only to discover that production 
        slowed and there were a lot of grumbles from the old workers, who had 
        been moulding by hand all their lives.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The machines were thrown out and 
        production soared again. "The experts asked me", said Oliver, "what one 
        man could do with just one pair of hands, so I told them. I said 'take
        <b>Arthur Bishop</b> (one of the workmen) – he makes over 1,000 bricks 
        every day. He
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Arthur Bishop, forming a brick by hand" vspace  =5 align=left src="images/new/arthur_bishop.jpg" width=265 height=222 >has 
        been doing that for the twenty years he has been with us. Or, to put it 
        another way, he has already built a town with his own hands’ ".</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They also tried forklift trucks 
        for carrying and stacking the bricks, but it was found that, in the 
        confined space, the men worked faster with their wheelbarrows.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The only concession they make to 
        the new age is the mechanical digger to get the clay out of the ground 
        and the machine which takes the stones out.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When the business started, in 
        the words of Oliver Barker … "Times were bad, but we got stuck in and we 
        have been fortunate in having a loyal and efficient workforce over the 
        years".</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They built the Works where they 
        knew the clay beds were. How did they know it wouldn’t just peter out 
        after a couple of years? "Well, my father had a sort of instinct for it 
        and he knew which way the clay beds would run". They now know that the 
        clay goes down for 300 feet.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After the War, there were forty 
        men working at the brickworks, but now there are only twelve. This is 
        not because the business is bad – on the contrary, it is better than it 
        has ever been. "I think the trouble is that the type of work doesn’t 
        seem to appeal to the youngsters, although financially it’s as good as 
        any job". The youngest of the workmen is 45 and for most of them, it’s 
        the only job they have ever had, apart from a break in the Army.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"I feel the business will die 
        out with us, but there will always be a need for hand-made bricks. I 
        can’t see anyone taking it over. We all make a comfortable living, but 
        there is no easy money. Everything you get you have to work for. I think 
        there will be a great reversion back to the skills and crafts, because 
        to make something of quality gives people more satisfaction. To make 
        something that is beautiful outweighs the financial gain".</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"An indication of this can be 
        seen in the young children. A lot come and visit the works. They get the 
        clay from us and the models they make they send back to us for firing. 
        Some of the stuff is very good, even from the elementary schools".</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some people may wonder why it is 
        necessary to have hand-made brick. What is wrong with the ordinary sort? 
        Well, one obvious reason is that the ordinary standard mass-produced 
        brick would look very out of place in a 15<sup>th</sup> century cottage 
        someone is repairing or adding to. Hand-made bricks are “made to 
        measure”. Anything but standard bricks have to be matched up. This takes 
        time and skill. Also the ‘fancy’ bricks can only be made by hand. These 
        are the ornate carved bricks which adorn many old buildings. Sometimes 
        only one brick of a certain type is needed. In such a case, a special 
        mould would have to be made.<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Inside the brick kiln" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/new/kiln.jpg" width="251" height="386"></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Another reason for the demand 
        for hand-made bricks is simply the quality. An ordinary brick could be 
        compared to a loaf of bread with only the outside cooked. To speed the 
        process up, they are compressed together and just given a quick firing. 
        To make them look good, artificial colouring is added to the outside.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A hand-made brick is not 
        compressed at all, but fired slowly for more than 48 hours. After this, 
        it is truly "cooked". It will not chip or flake like an ordinary brick.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At Arborfield, they have three 
        beehive, downdraught-type kilns which reach temperatures of 1,000 
        degrees Fahrenheit. They can each hold about 25,000 bricks, but, as 
        Oliver Barker says: "nature never did anything in straight lines; it’s 
        all angles. There are no cubes like modern architecture, in nature". He 
        refers to many of today’s housing schemes as "sardine cans".</span></p>
