<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><br><b>William Streak</b> was a shepherd, born 
in <b>Woodcote</b>, Oxfordshire. He married <b>Ellen</b> and lived in <b>Swallowfield</b> before 
moving to Arborfield by 1876 when daughter <b>Amy</b> was born. In 1881 they were 
living in 'Pudding Lane, The Only Cottage', which has long since disappeared. 
They were in Chamberlain's Farm in 1891 and 1901, and the family remained as 
tenants of the Newland Estate for many years, though <b>Ellen</b> out-lived her husband 
by nearly three decades.  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">However, the Streak surname in its 
various forms can be traced back far further. In 1617, <b>James Strike</b> was 
buried at Arborfield; also in 1617, <b>Thomas Streeke</b> married 
<b>Christian Howse</b> at Arborfield, and in 1619, <b>Katherine Streke</b> was baptised there. Nearly two centuries later, 
<b>Ann Streek</b> was baptised in 1773, the daughter of <b>Joseph and Ann</b>. She appears to have 
been a bit wayward, because her own daughters <b>Hannah</b> (baptised 1796),&nbsp;
<b>Maria</b> 
(baptised 1800) and <b>Hester</b> (baptised 1804) were described as 'base-born' 
or 'love-child'.&nbsp; Both Maria and Hester were married at Arborfield, to <b>
Thomas Lane</b> (1818) and <b>Henry Burrott</b> (1824).</span></p>
