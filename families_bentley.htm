The Bentley family had lived in Arborfield for over two centuries, occupying <b>
<a href="properties_Magnolia_Cottage.htm">Magnolia Cottage</a></b> and <b>
Whitewell Cottages</b>. Before the age of the 
      car, they were wheelwrights, but they eventually opened the local Garage. 
      The family got involved in local affairs, being both on the Parish Council 
      and the Church's Parish Council.</font>           
            
           </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">
Census details show that part of the family moved away in the late 1800's 
although they continued to own land in the village. The 1841 Census lists <b>
William</b> (45) and <b>Lucy Bentley</b> (39) with their children <b>William</b> 
(18), <b>Thomas</b> (15) and <b>Samuel</b> (4). William senior was a Wheelwright. By 
      1851, his widow, by now a schoolmistress, lived with her eldest son 
      William, who had taken over the business as a 'Wheelwright and Smith'. His 
      middle brother had gone into bricklaying.</font>      
             
              
     </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">
By 1861, <b>William</b> and <b>Samuel</b> lived in one house while <b>Thomas</b> 
and his mother <b>Lucy</b> lived two doors away. However, by 1871, there was no 
trace of William and Samuel. Instead, <b>William Vincent</b> from Gayford in 
Somerset had taken over as a 'Wheelwright Master employing 6 men and 3 boys'. 
Were the Vincents related to the Bentleys? We don't have any proof - yet. <b>
Thomas Bentley</b> had married <b>Ann</b> (then aged 44, from Alresford), and 
continued as a bricklayer. Their sons <b>William Henry</b> and <b>George</b> were 8 and 6 respectively.</font> 
    </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">
By 1881, <b>Henry</b> had become a&nbsp; '<b>Pupil Teacher</b>', while <b>George</b> started as a Wheelwright. They were listed 
      next door to William and Sarah Jane Vincent and their large family of 8 
      children; William's business had grown to be 'Agricultural Implement Maker 
      Employing 9 Men &amp; 1 Boy',</font> 
              
              
        </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">The 1891 Census still 
      only lists one Bentley household, though around this time, more Bentleys 
      were eligible to vote based on their property rights even though they 
      lived elsewhere. Thomas and Ann were retired, and son George, by now 26, 
      still lived with them adjacent to the Vincents.</font>
             
             
              
       </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">
By 1901, three Vincents were listed in the census, but it seems that William was 
temporarily somewhere else, since there is no 'head of the household' listed.&nbsp; 
The Vincents subsequently moved away from the village to run their business from 
Reading. <b>George Bentley</b> had married <b>Alice</b>, 8 years his junior, and 
they had two sons <b>William </b>(4) and </font>  <a name="Arthur_Bentley"><font size="2"> <b>Arthur</b> <b>John</b></font></a><font size="2"> (1).&nbsp; The 
      Wheelwright's business had stores and workshops across the road from 
      Magnolia Cottage, adjacent to 'Sunrise', as seen here.</font>

        lived in Magnolia Cottage while his sons lived next door in the two Whitewell 
        cottages. <span lang="en-gb">&nbsp;Here is a photo from about 1910 of George 
        and his family in the back garden. George died in 1916.</span></font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><b>John Bentley</b> - probably the second youngest in the 
        above photo - is shown here as the driver of a vehicle used during the 
        First World War at the Remount Depot. Was it the Bentley's own vehicle?</p>

with his wife in front of Magnolia Cottage.</p>

<p class="stbody">The second shows George sitting by his fireplace at Magnolia 
Cottage. George was thanked for his help in charging up the accumulators that 
provided the power to illuminate the Chancel of the Church in 1942 - see the 
P.C.C. Minutes <b><a href="church_new_PCC_1935.htm">here</a></b>.</p>

<p class="stbody"><font size="2"><b>William Bentley</b> ran a Market-day and Cinema coach 
      service to Reading in the 1920's in competition with the Thames Valley 
      Traction Company. The Parish Council supported the village's own service 
      in preference to that provided by the larger company.</font>       
             
            
     </p>
<p class="stbody"><font size="2"><b>Robin Bentley</b> was the last family occupant of Magnolia 
Cottage until he sold out in 1968. In the story by Guy Bentley, "Arborfield 
Street 1910", the front room was a <b>doctors’ surgery</b>. </font> </p>
<p class="stbody"><font size="2"><b>Whitewell Cottages</b> appear to have been built around 1870 to 
1880 (by Thomas?), and were later the homes of <b>Guy</b> and <b>John Bentley</b>. 
The doctor’s surgery moved into the extension of the cottage nearest Magnolia. 
The cottages were pulled down in the late 1960’s to make way for Whitewell 
Close. <span lang="en-gb"><b>Guy and Nell Bentley</b> eventually moved out of 
their cottage to live more or less on the same site - in Whitewell Close. Guy 
provided a fascinating glimpse of village life from 1910, which you can read <b>
<a href="Memories_Street.htm">here</a></b>.</span></font></p>
<p class="stbody"><font size="2">Although the Marriage Registers were stolen in the 1970's, we 
did have the approximate date of <b>Guy and Nell Bentley</b>'s marriage from the
<b>Register of Banns</b> from 1929 onwards. <b>Samuel Guy Bentley</b> and <b>
Ellen Louisa Smith</b>, both 'of this parish', were 
      married at Arborfield Church at the beginning of 1933; their first Banns 
      was on January 1st. We now have a <strong><a href="#wedding">newspaper 
      report of their wedding on 21st January</a></strong>          
         &nbsp;- see below. Nell served on 
the <b><a href="church_new_PCC_1935.htm">P.C.C.</a></b> and the Deanery 
      Synod for many years, while Guy was on the P.C.C.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

<p class="stbody"><font size="2"><b>John Bentley</b>, who served on the Parish Council from 
1945, died in 1956. His <b>funeral procession</b> can be seen by clicking <b>
