        Loddon provided power for several <b><a href="../properties_mill.htm">
        mills</a></b> along its length. But was it also used to transport

        ventured up the River Loddon as far as Swallowfield?</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">We do know that Swallowfield Park was 
        used by the King's consorts before, during and after Tudor times, as 
        documented by <b>Lady Constance Russell</b> in her book <b>'Swallowfield 
        and its Owners'</b>, published by Longman in 1901 and <b>
        <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/swallowfielditso00russ">

        <p class="stbody"><i><b><font size="2">"The garden is so beset with all 
        manner of sweete shrubbs that it perfumes the aire. The distribution 
        also of the quarters, walks, and parterres is excellent ; the nurseries, 
        kitchen garden, full of the most desirable plants ; two very noble 
        orangeries, well furnished ; but above all, the canall and fishponds, 
        the one fed with a white, the other with a black running water, fed by a 
        quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stor'd with fish that for 
        pike, carp, breame, and tench I never saw anything approaching it."</font></b></i></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">On page 269, we read:</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><i><b><font size="2">"Sir Henry Russell, after his 
        return from India, paid several visits to France and Italy, whence he 
        brought back many of the pictures and furniture now at Swallowfield ; 
        but he spent most
        of his time at Swallowfield, interesting himself in improving his 
        property, to which he added considerably by the purchase of the largest 
        part of the Manor of Arborfield, and the land going by the name of ' 
        Kenny's.'"</font></b></i></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">And in a footnote on the same page:</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><i><b><font size="2">"Amongst other alterations, Sir 
        Henry filled up the canal which appears in the old prints of 
        Swallowfield : it ran from the Lock Pool near the church to the Bow 
        Bridge ; and he also built the two bridges outside the park and the 
        Church Lodge. The two rivers, the Loddon and the Blackwater, join in 
        Swallowfield Park. The Loddon, the subject of Pope's fable of ' Lodona,' 
        rises near Aldershot and enters Berks in the parish of Swallowfield. It 
        crosses the Wokingham and Reading road at Loddon Bridge, and falls into 
        the Thames near Wargrave." </font></b></i> </p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">There is evidence that 
      Locks were used on river navigations in central Berkshire way back in the 
      1400s. The following is an extract from an article by <strong>Ernest 
      Dormer</strong> in the <strong>'Reading Mercury'</strong> of 18th February 1933 on the <strong>River Kennet 
      </strong>in<strong> Earley </strong>(part of the land described was taken 
      over by <strong>Reading</strong> to become 
      <strong>'Newtown'</strong>):</font></p>

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><font size="2"><em>"The 
      <strong>Thames</strong>, in its course from <strong>Caversham Mill to 
      Earley Point</strong> (about three-quarters of a mile this side of Sonning 
      Lock) runs in an arc, and within this arc is the Kennet embouchure. The 
      wide circular sweep can best be seen from the high embankment of the Great 
      Western Railway. From very early times there existed in the Liberty of 
      Earley six common fields and a common mead, the latter bordering the 
      Thames from a spot just below the present <strong>Dreadnought Inn</strong> 
      to <strong>Earley Point</strong>, where the boundary of the Liberty was 
      situate. These great fields represented, until the enclosures of the 18th 
      and early 19th centuries, the mainstay of economy in the district from 
      long before the Norman invasion. The only one that concerns us in these 
      notes is that called <strong>Wharf Field</strong>, which derived its name 
      apparently from the presence of a wharf at the junction of the rivers. 
      Wharf Field was the north-westerly of the six and reached to the angle 
      formed by the Kennet and the Thames. On its western side it touched the 
      boundary of the borough of Reading. The <strong>Wharf</strong> itself 
      seems to have extended from a site now occupied by an inn called 
      <strong>The Jolly Anglers on Kennet Side</strong> to the site of 
      <strong>The Dreadnought</strong>.</em></font></p>

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><font size="2"><em>"Now, 
      slightly to the west of the point at which the boundary strikes the Kennet 
      was anciently a <strong>lock belonging to the Abbot of Reading</strong> 
      and called <strong>Brokenbrow, or Brokenburgh lock</strong>. It is 
      obviously associated with the piece of land upon which the Saxon cemetery 
      was discovered, and the name would seem to be Saxon in origin.</em></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western" align="center"><em>"In the year 
      1404 the Abbot bethought him of an additional method of increasing the 
      monastic revenues. Before traders could bring their merchandise by boat up 
      to the common landing place at the <strong>High Bridge in 
      Reading</strong>, or carry it thence, they were <strong>compelled to pay 
      toll to the Abbot for passage through his lock and the waters which ran 
      within the precincts of the Abbey</strong>. </em></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western" align="center"><em>"It is common 
      knowledge that for several centuries the relations between the Gild 
      Merchant of Reading and the Abbot were not exactly cordial, and the 
      establishment of a wharf just outside the jurisdiction of the Abbot may 
      have been the outcome of a determination of the merchants of Reading to 
      evade the monasterial imposts and, after landing their produce at the 
      Wharf at Earley, convey it overland without further interference. 
      Similarly as a point of departure for London and Oxford bound traffic the 
      Wharf would have been effectual in evading the abbatial exactions. This, 
      then, may be an other reason for the origin of the Wharf; but, while it is 
      entitled to consideration, undue weight must not be attached to it; there 
      may have been other and more cogent reasons why the Wharf was fixed here, 
      and they may yet come to light."</em></p>
      <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm" class="western" align="left">So could the River 
      Loddon at Arborfield and Sindlesham&nbsp;also have been equipped with 
      locks at such an early date?&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">At <b>Sindlesham</b> there was another 
        boat-house near to Mill Lane, just downstream of the cluster of cottages
