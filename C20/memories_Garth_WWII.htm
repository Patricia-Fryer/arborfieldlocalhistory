<p class="stbody">Perhaps surprisingly, Hunt meetings continued after a fashion 
throughout WWII. Here are a few articles from the 'Reading Mercury' covering the 
Garth Hunt:</p> 
       
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">October 14th 1939:&nbsp; </span></p>

Successful Morning from Carters Hill - Hounds Kill Badger</font><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><font size="3">
</font></span></b></span></p>
<font size="2">
<p>The Garth lady pack met on Wednesday at Carters Hill, when quite a number of 
followers turned up, including <b>Lieut.-Col. F. G. Barker</b> (ex-Master), <b>
Mr. Budd</b>, <b>Mrs. Spiller</b>, <b>Miss Alfrey</b>, <b>Mr. Bye</b>, <b>Mr. R. 
H. R. Palmer</b>, ex-Master, <b>Mrs. E. M. Sturges</b>, <b>Capt. Pawson</b>, <b>
Mr. Dimond</b>, <b>M. Smith</b>, <b>Mr. J. H. Simonds</b> and several others.
</p>
<p>The Holt was the first draw, and hounds soon had cubs on the move. After 
working in cover for a time, a fox broke away across the meadows, and hounds 
were soon streaming along behind him. They crossed into a little cover near the 
brook, and went through Dog Kennels. Going over the road, they went across by 
Newlands Park to the top of the hill, and then turned left-handed by the cricket 
pitch into Bear Wood. They ran with quite a good scent all through the Bear Wood 
covers by the lakes, and turned right-handed into the bracken and fir trees in 
Bear Wood Park, quite close to the Coombes. It is quite probable that hounds 
killed their cub in the thick covers of Bear Wood, where it was difficult to 
tell what really happened.</p>
<p>Hounds were called out of Bear Wood, and taken back by the Mole down to the 
Holt at Carters Hill. This was drawn through again, but it was tenantless this 
time. Loaders Copse yielded a fox which soon crossed the lane and turned 
right-handed through Spring Copse, over the lane back into Loaders Copse, where, 
after a nice hunt, they marked him to ground.</p>
<p>The next draw was the Osier Bed, and a fox was viewed at the end of the 
osiers. He was headed back, but after a time he managed to break away, running 
through the other Carters Hill covers near the river, as if for the Gorse. He 
turned short left-handed into the Holt at Carters Hill. Hounds returned to 
Loaders Copse, and killed a cub and a badger weighing quite forty pounds. This 
was one of the best mornings hounds had had this season. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Garth lady pack met on Wednesday at 
the <b>Mole, Arborfield</b>. The Holt at <b>Carters Hill</b> was the first draw, 
and after a time a fox was found. He was viewed just outside the cover and 
turned back into the Holt again. Hounds spent a considerable time before they 
could put him on his legs, but eventually they got on the line of him. They 
hunted round the Holt before he broke away, as if for the Gorse, but turned 
towards Dog Kennel and on towards <b>Arborfield Church</b>. He turned back 
towards <b>Arborfield Hall Gorse</b>, and then towards Dog Kennel. Going on to 
Carters, and on through the Holt, crossing the lane through <b>Spring Coppice</b>, 
and into a small cover, and leaving <b>Betty Grove</b> on the right, he swung 
across the open meadows, and he eventually led hounds over the river into the 
South Berks territory. Reynard then ran down into the valley at <b>Lower Earley</b>, 
and up the hill into <b>Maiden Erleigh</b>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hounds were taken back into their own 
territory and found another fox near <b>Sindlesham Mill</b>. He also gave them 
quite a nice hunt. The <b>Coombes</b> yielded another fox, which was hunted away 
towards <b>Newlands</b>. After hounds had again found in the Coombes they were 
taken on into <b>Bear Wood</b>, where a fox got up just behind them. They were 
quickly on the line, hunting him into the Coombes, and then back into the Bear 
Wood side, where they nearly caught him. He got back to the Coombes, but they 
could do little more with him.</span></p>

following week. The Garth met at different places in their area week by week,
