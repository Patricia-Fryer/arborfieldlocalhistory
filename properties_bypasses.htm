      that eventually saw light of day (including realigning the Reading Road 
      and <strong><a href="#Bridges">replacing the river 
      bridges</a></strong>

<p align="left">The <b>Garrison</b> was generating heavy traffic by the late 
        1930's; its main entrance was in <b>Eversley Road</b>, which was clearly 
        unsuitable for lorries. <b>Berkshire County Council's&nbsp; Planning 
        Committee</b> Minutes for <b>January 1945</b> [Berkshire Record Office reference 
        C/CL/C3/21/1] reported as follows:</p>
        <p><b>Reading – Eversley Road (A.327):</b></p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Standard width</b>: The County Surveyor reported that the 
            owners of the <b><a name="Bramshill_Hunt1">‘Bramshill Hunt’ Public House</a></b> proposed to 
        rebuild the premises, and before deciding on the site for a new 
        building, had asked for information about road improvements which the 
        Council contemplated carrying out in the future. There is an ‘S’ bend in 
        the road near the present public house, and in 1939 the Ministry of War 
        Transport approved a new 'middle of the road' line in order that the 
        road might be straightened out in the future. The Committee consider 
        that the Council should now adopt a standard width for this proposed 
        improvement based on the new middle of the road line which had already 
        been approved. 
        <ol>
        <p><b>Recommended:</b> That, in pursuance of Section 1 of the 
        Restriction of Ribbon Development Act, 1935, the Council do adopt a <b>
        standard width of 80 feet</b> in respect of the section of the Reading – 
        Eversley Road (A.327) from the entrance to <b>Targetts Farm, Arborfield</b>, 
        southwards to a point 110 yards north of the southern boundary of <b>
        Martaix Farm, Finchampstead</b>, in accordance with a plan prepared by 
        the County Surveyor. </p></ol>   
                        
                     
                        
                         
                        
                         
                      
                        
                  </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" type="a">
          <li><b>Construction of new length of road</b>: - In view of the 
          importance of this road as a traffic route, the Committee considered 
          proposals of the County Surveyor for the improvement of other sections 
          of the road in the future. These proposals included provision being 
          made for (a) the length of new road about <b>1,266 yards</b> in length 
          to the <b>west of Arborfield Cross</b>, and (b) another section of new 
          road about <b>2,600 yards</b> in length, commencing at a point near 
          <b>Arborfield Bridge</b>, then northwards and joining the existing road at a 
          point near <b>Ducketts Farm</b>. This proposal would enable traffic to 
          avoid the narrow road through <b><a name="Shinfield_Green">Shinfield Green</a></b> and the built-up area 
        there. 
        <ol><p><b>Recommended:</b> (a) That the line of the proposed sections of new 
        road, referred to above, as shown on the plans presented by the County 
        Surveyor, be approved. (b) That the East Berkshire Regional Planning 
        Committee be asked to make provision in their Town and Country Planning 
        Scheme for reserving the land which should be required for the sections 
        of new road; that pending the carrying out of the road-works the Interim 
        Development Authority be requested to refuse permission to develop on 
        the site of the proposed sections of new road, on the understanding that 
        any claims for compensation would be dealt with and settled by the 
        County Council. </p> </ol>    
           </li>
        </ol>
        <p align="left">By mid-1946, the <b>Abercrombie Plan for Greater London
        </b>was being discussed by Berkshire County Council. Although its 
        proposal for a satellite town for <b>White Waltham</b> was strongly resisted, 
        the proposed <b>New Town at Bracknell</b> was embraced. At that time, it 
        was thought that around 25,000 people would be accommodated there, plus 
        around 5,000 in <b>Wokingham</b>. As it later turned out, <b>Bracknell 
        Development Corporation</b> attracted lots of Government funding and acted 
        as the overspill for Chiswick, Brentford and the surrounding area, while 
        <b>Wokingham</b> received no extra funding, but nevertheless became home for 
        many more than 5,000 people. <b>Berkshire County Council</b> started planning 
        for by-passes around all known pinch-points, and a long list was 
        presented to the <b>Highways and Bridges Committee</b> at its November 1946 
        meeting:</p>

        for a highway <b>109 feet wide</b> with two 32-feet wide carriageways, a 
        15-feet central island and two 15-feet wide verges. The bridges of the 
        road would have a clear span of 89 feet. No provision would be made for 
        pedestrians or cyclists, except at the River Thames Bridge, where 
        footpaths and cycle tracks would be provided over the river bridge. […]</p>

        Government, and the <b>Maidenhead By-Pass</b> didn't get completed until 
        1959. Just as the population learned to 'make do and mend', so the local 
        authorities had to wait years for any major improvements to their roads, 
        by which time housing development had made several of the schemes listed 
        above impractical. 
        </p>

        <p align="left">For many years, the A327 didn't even get a footpath along the Reading Road to the north

        despite continued pleas from <b><a href="anpcouncil.htm">Arborfield and

        <p align="left">A fatal accident in early 1950 strengthened demands for

      </font>:</p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">Work is to start this 
      month on improving part of the A327 (Farnborough – Reading road) where it 
      passes over three bridges at Arborfield, just south east of 
      Reading.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">The three bridges, which 
      are narrow and have weight restrictions of 12 tons, take the A327 over the 
      River Loddon and two associated streams. There is also a sharp bend in the 
      road between two of the bridges. Mrs. Barbara Castle, Minister of 
      Transport, has made a grant of £73,575 to Berkshire County Council towards 
      the estimated £98,100 cost of realigning the road, replacing two of the 
      three bridges and strengthening the third one on its present alignment by 
      replacing the arch with concrete tubes.</font></p>

        <p class="stbody"><font size="2">On this section of the 
      A327, the width of the carriageway varies between 18 ft. and 20 ft. The 
      width between the parapets of the bridges is about 16 ft. The improvement 
      schedule will provide for a 24 ft. wide carriageway for about 600 yards. 
      The scheme is scheduled to take 18 months to complete.</font></p>

      to get one section of the works back into production again. Much of the 
      factory floor was waterlogged.</font></p>
