The local newspapers were very restricted in column space during World War 2, 
and tended to report on deaths in active service or resulting from accidents. 
However, throughout the conflict, they did manage to find space to record short 
obituaries of local residents.<p>Bearing in mind that Arborfield Church's Burial 
Register was stolen in the mid-1970s, we don't have a record of burials after 
1925. It is therefore appropriate that we give space to these obituaries and 
reports of funerals from the local newspapers. Most of the articles are from the 
'Reading Mercury', but a few are from the 'Times and Weekly News' as indicated. </p>
