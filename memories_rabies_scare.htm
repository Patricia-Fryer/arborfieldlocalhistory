        <p class="stbody">In Autumn 1920, the local papers gave warning that a 
        case of rabies had been confirmed in Reading. The 'Reading Mercury' 
        reported this as follows on October 2nd:</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><i><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="4">THE RABIES 
        OUTBREAK AT READING</font></span></b></i></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">As a result of the outbreak 
        of rabies at Reading, an area of a circle of 20 miles has been placed 
        under the Muzzling Order. The removal of the dogs from this area is 
        prohibited except under a licence issued by the Ministry of Agriculture. 
        The scheduled area consists of Chepping, Wickham, Watlington and Didcot 
        on the north; Farnborough and Odiham on the south; Beaconsfield, Windsor 
        and Windlesham on the east; and the boundary of the Wilts area, which 
        consists of Whitchurch, Woodhay and Frawley, on the west.</span></i></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">In consequence of dog-madness 
        at Reading, special regulations have been applied to a “dangerous area”. 
        Within the “dangerous area”, all dogs must be muzzled at all times, 
        unless confined in an enclosure from which they cannot escape. Dogs kept 
        in houses must be tied up, muzzled, or so confined that escape is 
        impossible. Dogs tending cattle or sheep need not be led, but must be 
        muzzled. In a public place all dogs must be led. No dog may be used for 
        any sporting purposes within the “dangerous area”. No dog may be removed 
        out of the “dangerous area” to any destination except by licence of the 
        Ministry of Agriculture.</span></i></p>

        been a notice outside the Police House at the Cross.&nbsp;How many local 
        families would have owned dogs as pets, let alone as working animals?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The October 9<sup>th</sup> 
        edition reported two more cases in Caversham.</span></p>

        South Berks Hunt met at Stratfield Saye, and the opening notes for the 
        Garth Hunt referred to the restricted area for Rabies becoming much 
        smaller so that hunting could commence in the countryside.</span></p>

        </font></span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We haven’t found an analysis so far in the local press. However, we can 
        speculate that there was a major opportunity for animals to be brought 
        in undetected to the enormous ‘Dump’ at Slough (which later became the 
        Slough Trading Estate).  </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This site, covering 600 acres off the Bath Road 
        to the west of the town, was originally intended to be used to build a 
        huge motor repair depot to service the war effort. It was still 
        unfinished when the war ended in November 1918. Buildings to house 
        the soldiers and workers formed an extensive complex of wooden huts 
        which later became known as Timbertown, and which housed many of the 
        unemployed who poured into the parish in the 1920's and 30's looking for 
        work. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There was plenty of opportunity 
        for animals to be hidden undetected in the many vehicles that were 
        brought back from France and Belgium after the War. The vehicles are 
        likely to have been brought to 'Slough Dump' (as it was known) by train 
        from the military port at Southampton, and might have been left at 
        marshalling yards in Reading <i>en route</i>. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The site at Slough eventually 
        contained 17,000 used cars, trucks and motorcycles left over after the 
        war. The idea was to refurbish them and sell them to meet the steadily 
        growing public demand for vehicles, and this became the spur to create 
        the <b>
        <a href="http://www.freelancejournalist.co.uk/Slough%20Estates%20-%20History.htm">
        Slough Trading Estate.</a></b> The local bus company, <b>Thames Valley 
        Traction Co.</b>, was known to have bought several Thorneycroft chassis 
        from Slough, and no doubt many local carriers and business equipped 
        themselves from the same source.</span></p>
