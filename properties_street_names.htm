        &nbsp;<p>All street names in Arborfield and Newland are listed here in 
        alphabetical order, together with a derivation of their names, if known:</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Anderson Crescent</font></b><a href="properties_cross_1920.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Canon Anderson dedicating the War Memorial in 1920." vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Memorial_Dedication_1920_3.jpg" width="61" height="114"></a></p>
        <p>This road forms half of the ‘Newland Estate’, which was built by 
        Wokingham Rural District Council in the late 1940’s after much 
        discussion about the best location (see Newland Parish Council Minutes). 
        It was named after <b><a href="C20/families_Anderson.htm">Canon Joshua Anderson</a></b>.</p>
        <p>Not only was Canon  Anderson the Rector of <b>St. Bartholomew's Arborfield</b> for half 
        a century until the mid-1940’s; he was also Chairman of the <b>
        <a href="arbcouncil.htm">Arborfield 
        Parish Meetings</a></b> – later to become Arborfield Parish Council.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Arbery Way</font></b></p>
        <p><a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Pond_2.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="In 1910, Mr Arbery lived in the left-hand cottage by the Pond." vspace  =5 align=left src="images/Street_1910/Pond_2.jpg" width=166 height=107 ></a>The 
        only ‘Arbery’ in the Victorian Census Returns was Jane, aged 37 in 1891, 
        a servant at Arborfield Hall. She was originally from Bradfield.</p>
        <p>In 1910, a <b>Mr. Arbery</b> was butler to John Simonds of Newlands. 
        He lived in one of the Pond Cottages opposite 'The Bull' Public House.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Attwood Drive</font></b></p>
        <p>According to Guy Bentley, <b>Alfred Attwood</b> worked in the 
        Blacksmith's workshop at the back of the Bentley family's wheelwright 
        premises, almost opposite the Village Hall. The wheelwright's eventually 
        became a motor garage, which probably meant that there was no longer a 
        need to employ a blacksmith, especially since Mr. Mattingley was already 
        Blacksmith to the Village itself.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Baird Road</font></b></p>
        <p>This is a link road around the Garrison, built when the Garrison 
        Bypass was created. Was it named after John Logie Baird? </p>
        <p>For many years, 
         
        the street lights along Baird Road were an incongruous feature of the rural area, because 
        they served no real purpose, especially since Arborfield Cross had few, 
        if any, street lights on Eversley Road until the five-way roundabout was 
        built in 2004. </p>
        <p>The main entrance to the Army property 
        behind Baird Road, which has now become the <b>Penrose Park</b> estate, was by the 
        <b><a href="properties_guardroom.htm">Guardrooms</a></b> in 
        what became Bramshill 
        Close. More recently, Baird Road’s gates still divided the military 
        housing from the civilian, though a second set of barbed-wire covered gates behind 
        the ‘Bramshill Hunt’ had been removed when preparations started for the 
        new estate. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Barker Close</font></b></p>
        <p><b><a href="properties_Brickworks.htm">Whitehall Brick and Tile Works</a></b> was founded in 1934 by <b>Arthur and 
        Oliver Barker</b>. They had first worked for their father, who was manager 
        at the former <b>Toutley</b> brickworks at Wokingham. <b>Barker Close</b> is on the 
        site of the old Whitehall brickworks, which was itself part of the old 
        Whitehall Farm, split up when the Remount Depot had expanded. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Barrett's Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>This is a short stretch of by-way linking <b>Carter's Hill Lane</b> 
        with the settlement of Carter's Hill. Part of it runs parallel with the 
        concrete track serving <b>Arborfield Hall Farm</b>. We don't yet know 
        who 'Barrett' was.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Bearwood Road</font></b></p>
        <p><b>Poulter’s Lodge</b> on <b>Bearwood Road</b> forms the northern extremity of Arborfield 
        and Newland Parish. 
        <b><a href="properties_bearwood.htm">‘Bare Wood’</a></b> was enclosed in the early 1800’s, and the 
        Walter family built the <b>Mansion</b> on the Estate to the south (now
        <b><a href="properties_RMNS.htm">Bearwood College</a></b>).</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Bentley Drive</font></b><a href="families_bentley.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="George Bentley and family in the back garden of Magnolia Cottage" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Bentleys.jpg" width="326" height="220"></a></p>
        <p>This name has connections with Arborfield stretching back a couple of 
        hundred years. The <a href="families_bentley.htm"> <b>Bentley</b> </a>family were wheelwrights, eventually opening the 
        first motor garage in the area, hiring out charabancs and running a 
        coach service to take the villagers 
        to the cinemas in Reading. </p>
        <p><b>Guy Bentley</b>, who wrote his <b><a href="Memories_Street.htm">
        'stroll through the village in 1910'</a></b>, lived in the village all 
        his life, spanning most of the 20th Century. Guy and his wife Nell are 
        mentioned in many web pages on this site, in particular the article on
        <b><a href="church_new_PCC_1935.htm">Arborfield Parochial Church Council</a></b>.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Betty Grove Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>Berry Grove, or Betty Grove, is on the border with Winnersh. It 
        originally formed part of <b>Carter’s Hill Farm</b> (see the <b>
        <a href="C_H_1919.htm">Auction Sale document</a></b> for more details).</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Bramshill Close</font></b></p>
        <p>This used to form part of the main <b>Eversley Road</b> south of Arborfield 
        Cross. When the Garrison Bypass<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The first Autumn meet of the Farley Hill Beagles in 1931, in what is now Bramshill Close" vspace    =5 align=left src="images/new/FH_Beagles_RM_10_Oct31.JPG" width=289 height=151 > was built, this section was severed, and 
        became a cul-de-sac, taking its name from the <b>
        <a href="properties_Bramshill_Hunt.htm">‘Bramshill Hunt’</a></b> public 
        house. This kept its name even after the <b>
        <a href="C20/memories_Hunting_in_Berkshire.htm">Bramshill Hunt</a></b> 
        was replaced by the <b><a href="memories_garth.htm">Garth Hunt</a></b> 
        in 1852; it remained a meeting place for the Hunt and for the <b>Farley 
        Hill Beagles</b>, as shown in this photo from the 1930's. </p>
        <p> <b>Bramshill</b> itself is around 4 miles away, and is now home of 
        the Police College.</p>
        <p>Reading Local Studies Library has a <b>
        <a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1235200.PDF">postcard</a></b> 
        of what became <b>Bramshill Close</b>, taken in the 1930's, long before 
        the bypass was built.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Brant Close</font></b></p>
        <p>Named after the builder of the four bungalows, <b>Ken Brant</b>.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Bushell Way</font></b><a href="images/Nicky_Ford/Bull_3.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Nicky_Ford/TN_Bull_3.jpg" width="146" height="94"></a></p>
        <p><b><a href="WW1/families_bushell.htm">Joseph Bushell</a></b> was the landlord of the ‘Bull’ Inn at 
        Arborfield Cross, and was also appointed an Overseer of the Poor in 1919 
        (this would have been considered a ‘Conflict of Interest’ in more modern 
        times!). He died in 1950 at the age of 94, one of the oldest landlords 
        of a Simonds pub.</p>
        <p>Many of the houses of <b>Bushell Way</b> are on the site of the <b>
        <a href="properties_guardroom.htm">Guardrooms</a></b> on Bramshill 
        Close.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Carter's Hill Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>This un-made track from Church Lane leads to what used to be <b>Carter's Hill Farm</b>, now split up 
        unto Carters Hill House, Tudor House and other former out-buildings. 
        It’s not certain whether <b>'Carter'</b> was a person’s surname, or the occupation 
        of ‘Carter’, essential to the smooth running of farms before the days of 
        mechanisation.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Chamberlain Gardens</font></b></p>
        <p><a href="images/M_Shearn/Chamberlain_Gdns.jpg">
        <img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Chamberlain Gardens, where it branches off from Melrose Gardens" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/M_Shearn/Chamberlain_Gdns_TN.jpg" width="187" height="121"></a>Named after <b>Chamberlain’s Farm</b>. The old farmhouse still exists 
        on Swallowfield Road, but hasn’t been used as a farmhouse for at least a 
        century and a half. For many years, it formed the Laundry for the 
        <b>Newlands Estate</b>, owned for many generations by the <b>
        <a href="families_simonds.htm">Simonds family</a></b>. </p>
        <p><b>Chamberlain, or Chamberlains, Gardens</b> (depending on which road 
        sign you read), was built in three phases; the western end, then the 
        north-eastern end, and finally a wedge-shaped piece of land in between 
        them, when it became available. The picture on the left shows the first 
        part, at its junction with <b>Melrose Gardens</b>, and is from <b>
        <a href="pictures_shearn2.htm">Martin Shearn's collection</a></b>.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Church Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>This originally led to the centuries-old <b><a href="church_old.htm">Church</a></b>, next to the old
        <b>Arborfield Hall</b>. However, the old<a href="families_conroy_chapel.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The remains of the old church from the west end, June 1937" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/Thumb/Old_Church_June_1937_West.jpg" width="260" height="167"></a> church was abandoned in the 1860’s 
        when a new Church building had been erected further south, but on the same 
        road. The roof the main church building was removed soon after the new <b>
        <a href="church_new.htm">St. Bartholomew's Church</a></b> was 
        consecrated , leaving the self-contained <b>
        <a href="families_conroy_chapel.htm">Conroy Chapel</a> </b>as shown in 
        this photo from 1937.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;However, the chapel's roof was later removed when it became 
        unsafe, and the whole building is now just a romantic ruin.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Cole Lane</font></b></p>
        <p><b>Cole or Coles Lane</b> was part of a major route to Wokingham in 
        the days before motor traffic. Its surface deteriorated badly in the 
        late 1940's when it was heavily used by motor bikes (see <b>
        <a href="newlandcouncil.htm">Newland Parish 
        Council Minutes</a></b>), and by logging lorries used to take newly-felled 
        timber to High Wycombe for furniture making. The ford is the deepest on 
        the Mole Brook. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Copse Barnhill Lane</font></b><a href="properties_Mole_Inn.htm"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The old 'Mole Inn', with Copes Barnhill Lane to the right." vspace="5" align="right" src="images/Thumb/Mole1.jpg" width="185" height="121"></a></p>
        <p>This gravelled byway leads from Mole Road by the former 'Mole' Public 
        House up towards Carter's Hill. </p>
        <p>There used to be a mediaeval barn at Carter's Hill, but it was down by 
        the ford, not on a hill-top; it's now re-erected at the Chiltern 
        Open-air Museum. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Emblen Crescent</font></b></p>
        <p>This road (note that <b>‘Emblen’</b> is often mis-spelt as ‘<b>Emblem’</b>) forms half of the 
        so-called <b>‘Newland Estate’</b>, which was built by 
        Wokingham Rural District Council in the late 1940’s. <b>Stephen Emblen</b> 
        was a Churchwarden at Arborfield for many years. His son, <b>Harry</b>, 
        moved to South Africa, but kept in regular contact with his old parish. </p>
        <p>The name might have been chosen to commemorate <b>Arthur Emblen</b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">, 
        who was mentioned by </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 700">Guy Bentley</span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
        in his </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 700">
        <a href="Memories_Street.htm">'stroll through Arborfield in 1910'</a></span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> 
        as a Postman. According to Guy, Arthur was 
known&nbsp;to&nbsp;everyone as 'Plummy Emblen'. He lived in Swallowfield Road. 
        Guy said of Arthur: "When out of uniform he repairs boots, shoes and 
        harness in his little workshop, in his spare time."</span></p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Eversley Road</font></b></p>
        <p>The road south-east of Arborfield Cross was known as <b>‘Arborfield 
        Street’</b> in Victorian times, but more recently the stretch from here 
        southwards has been called <b>‘Eversley Road’.</b> However, when the 
        Garrison Bypass was formed in the late 1960’s, the original line of 
        Eversley Road was broken up into a series of culs-de-sac: <b>Rickman 
        Close</b>, <b>Bramshill Close</b>, <b>Whitehall Drive</b> and <b>Sheerlands Road</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Eversley</b> is a village four miles away, just over the border in 
        Hampshire; the church has an ancient Sarsen Stone in the Nave, normally 
        covered by removable floorboards. <b>Charles Kingsley</b> was Rector, 
        and wrote his wonderful story <b>'The Water Babies'</b> while there. 
        There are many local references in this book, which is written to two 
        different audiences: firstly as a children's story, and as a secondly as 
        very sharp political satire. If you want to know more about the local 
        references, get a copy that has explanatory footnotes.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Faraday Close</font></b></p>
        <p>Named after the great physicist.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Fleming Close</font></b></p>
        <p>Named after the great physicist.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Gerring Road</font></b></p>
        <p><b>George Gerring</b> was a long-time manager at <b>Whitehall Brick 
        and Tile Works</b>.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Gipsy Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>This byway is in <b>Betty Grove</b>, from <b>Loaders Lane</b> to <b>
        Mole Road</b> just by the Nirvana sports centre in Winnersh, but for 
        some reason the name has been changed to <b>'Harrow Lane'</b> at this 
        point. The name&nbsp; 'Gipsy Lane' illustrates the long-standing Gipsy 
        associations with this area. Several families who can trace their Gipsy 
        lineage now have permanent homes nearby. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Gravelpithill Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>The <b>Gravel Pit</b> on this lane was used for a long time as a 
        source of road-building material when the Parish was responsible for 
        maintaining roads and tracks. For many years until the mid-1990's, the 
        surface was a quagmire in wet conditions, but it was allowed to be 
        improved in order to make an easier route to Ellis Hill Farm and the 
        cottage opposite. It's the way for motorists to reach the monthly <b>
        <a href="http://www.wysipig.com/">Farmers' Markets</a></b>. </p>
        <p>Part-way along <b>Gravelpithill Lane</b> from <b>Coombes Lane</b> is 
        a fence and front gate, the only remains of some old Game-Keepers' 
        cottages.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Greensward Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>Simply a delightful local name, but in fact <b>Greensward Lane</b> 
        was once known rather more prosaically as <b>'Farley Hill Road'</b>.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Harts Close</font></b></p>
        <p><b>Harts Cottages</b> originally stood at the entrance to this small 
        estate, but were demolished to make a roadway through. A <b>Henry Hart</b> was listed as ‘Grocer and Baker’ in the 1891 
        Census, and was mentioned in Guy Bentley’s <b>
        <a href="Memories_Street.htm">‘stroll through the village in 1910’</a></b>.
        </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Howell Close</font></b></p>
        <p>No obvious local connection.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Hughes Green</font></b></p>
        <p>In earlier times, this locality was simply <b><font size="2">‘Ewes 
        Green’</font></b>, but somehow the ‘H’ was added and the spelling 
        changed. There is an unmade road 
        leading across a ford up to <b>Ellis Hill Farm</b>. In the mid-1990's 
        the ford was replaced by a bridge made of steel girders, but this was 
        erected without planning permission, and was ordered to be dismantled.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Julkes Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>A short gravelled byway in <b>Carter's Hill</b>, this leads to Julkes 
        Cottages. So far, we haven't discovered who 'Julke' or 'Julkes' was. </p>

        <a href="properties_Pride_Map.htm">Thomas Pride Map</a></b> of 1790 
        shows the road only as a pair of dotted lines. The area was long 
        associated with the <b><a href="families_allwright.htm">Allwright</a> </b>and <b>Targett </b>
        families, but there's no obvious link to the name 'Langley'.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Link Way</font></b></p>
        <p>This road’s prosaic name is derived from the link from the <b>‘Newland 
        Estate'</b> (Anderson Crescent and Emblen Cresent) to the <b>Eversley Road</b>. 
         
        </p>
        <p>Although there seems to be a more poetic connection at the house named ‘Linkawasa’, 
        home of the late <b><a href="ANPCC_1994.htm">Amirthalingam 'Panch' Panchalingam</a></b>, we are told that <b>Linkawasa</b> is 
        a place in <b>Sri Lanka</b>, and not the reason for the street name.</p>

        <p><b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">In 1910,</span> Mr. Mabett</b> was 
        a chauffeur to <b>John Simonds</b>. His family lived in the left-most of the

        <p>We have information on the cottage as it was in 1947, when the 
        Newlands Estate was broken up on the death of John's son, <b>John Hayes 
        Simonds</b>, to help pay Death Duties. The cottages probably hadn't changed much 
        since they were built in the 1870's. See Lot 16 from the Auction by

        <p><b><font size="3">Melrose Gardens</font></b></p>
        <p>Not a local name, but a town in the Scottish Borders. The road was 
        built in three distinct steps:<br>1) in the late 1950's down to the 
        footpath leading from the Shop to Arborfield Court;<br>2) in the early 
        1960's, down to the hedge then surrounding Chamberlain's Farm (the 
        original hedge can be seen from the field behind Melrose Gardens); and<br> 
        3) finally in 1963, when the Chamberlain's Estate was first built.

        <b>Melrose Gardens</b> formed a junction with <b>Swallowfield Road</b>, 
        but this was later stopped-up by a new semi-detached house designed to 
        fit the space - viewed from Swallowfield Road, it's asymmetrical. The 
        photo on the left is from <b><a href="pictures_shearn2.htm">Martin Shearn's collection</a></b>. 
        Martin mentioned that 
        the distinct kink in the road where it joins Chamberlain Gardens was a 
        safety feature - to prevent vehicles from careering down the hill, out 
        of control.</p>
        <p>To see what Eversley Road was like at the top of the hill, from well 
        before Melrose Gardens was built, see a postcard of <b>
        <a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1235208.PDF">Hillcrest 
        in the 1930's</a></b> from <b>Reading Local Studies Library</b>. There 
        must have been some major earth-moving before the bungalows were built - 
        on either side of Eversley Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Milam Close</font></b></p>
        <p>The spelling <b>‘Mileham’</b> is a name long connected with Arborfield; 
        <b>Mileham 
        Cottage</b> is near the ‘Swan’ public house. However, the spelling <b>'Milam'</b> 
        appeared in the 1871 Census when 
        <b>Thomas and Sarah Milam</b> from Swallowfield were living in the area as 
        agricultural labourers.</p>
        <p><b><a href="properties_Mole_Inn.htm#Samuel_Milam">Samuel Milam</a></b> 
        was the landlord of the <b><a href="properties_Mole_Inn.htm">'Mole Inn'</a></b> 
        for many years, taking over from his father <b>Thomas</b>.</p>
        <p>More recently, <b>F. J. Milam (Builder)</b> of 
        Finchampstead built the <a href="C20/properties_VH.htm"> <b>Village Hall</b>
        </a>in 1931, and it could be Mr. Milam who is 
        commemorated in '<b>Milam Close'.</b> It is on the site of 
        the <b>Garrison Community Centre</b>, now relocated to the east of <b>Sheerlands 
        Road</b>. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the name could commemorate <b>Matthew Milam</b>, a 
        Churchwarden from 1653, whose name is engraved on one of the Church 
        Bells (see the <b><a href="Arborfield_WI.htm">Women's Institute History

        <p>The little stream that runs from Barkham to the River Loddon starts 
        as the <b>‘Barkham Brook’</b>, but changes its name on its way past the Coombes, 
        becoming the <b>‘Mole Brook’</b>. The picture on the right, from the <b>
        <a href="pictures_collier.htm">Collier Collection</a></b>, shows the 
        original hump-back bridge over the Mole Brook. Despite being able to 
        carry heavy tanks on manoeuvres during World War II, it was rebuilt 
        because it was deemed too weak to take modern traffic. The new flat 
        bridge allows much higher speeds. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Parkcorner Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>Surely the Park is the Bearwood Estate? This lane leads from <b>Mole

        <p>It nearly became a <b>Waste Transfer Station</b> in the mid-1990’s, 
        but there was a concerted campaign to prevent this from happening, 
        including a 'road block' one Sunday in late 1994, as shown in the photo 
        on the right. </p>
        <p>The buildings were used as light industrial 
        units for a few years until  the site became simply <b>‘Poppyfields’</b> - a 
        clear reference to the trenches in World War I.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Pudding Lane</font></b></p>
        <p>A byway linking Swallowfield Road with Reading Road. There used to be 
        a cottage along this lane, on the recreation ground side, but traces 
        have long since disappeared. Why it's called 'Pudding', we don't yet 
        know. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Rayner Drive</font></b></p>
        <p>In the 1901 Census, <b>William Rayner</b> lived near Arborfield Bridge as a 
        Gamekeeper, with his wife Maria. A few years later, he was Landlord of 
        the 'Bull' Public House, before <b>Joseph Bushell</b> (another former 
        Gamekeeper) took over. </p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Reading Road</font></b></p>
        <p>Much of the A327 north of the Cross is called the <b>‘Causeway’ </b>rather 
        than <b>‘Reading Road’</b>, because it was built on an embankment to 
        overcome frequent flooding in winter. </p>
        <p>By the way, a possible derivation of the name ‘Shinfield’ is 
        <b>‘Shine-field’</b>, from the appearance of the fields during flooding.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Rickman Close</font></b></p>
        <p>Now a cul-de-sac following the building of the Garrison Bypass, this 
        is named after <b>Captain Stuart Hamilton Rickman (R.N.)</b>, who occupied
        <b><a href="properties_Arborfield_Cottage.htm">Arborfield Grange</a></b> for many years. 
        Reading Local Studies Library has a <b>
        <a href="http://readingimages.epixtech.co.uk/loc/1235194.PDF">postcard</a></b> 
        of what became <b>Rickman Close</b> in the 1930's, long before the A327 
        was diverted to join the bypass.</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">School Road</font></b></p>
        <p>Named after the school that was built in 1870. The properties on the 
        east side of this road were a detached part of Wokingham until the 
        situation was remedied in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. 
        Electors would have had to go to Wokingham to vote. Was this road originally named <b>"Holloway's Lane"</b>?</p>
        <p><b><font size="3">Sheerlands Road</font></b></p>
        <p>This is part cul-de-sac and part of the 
        old <b>Eversley Road</b> to the south of Baird Road, linking to the A327.
        When the bypass was being planned, the Parish Council was asked to 
        suggest a suitable name for this stretch. The then Parish Clerk noted 
        that '<b>Sheerlands</b>' is the name of the 
      large field at the end of the then developed Eversley Road, on the 
      opposite side from the Garrison. </font></tt></font></font><font style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"><tt>

        <p>Whitewell Cottages used to be on Eversley Road, with the White Well

        <p>The cottages were demolished to provide access to the new Whitewell Close, 
        and some of the occupants – notably <b>Guy and Nell Bentley</b> – moved to

        <p>This by-way runs from 'Bound Oak' on the border with Farley Hill to
