      <p>In the 21st Century, it's difficult to imagine 
      that fox-hunting was a wide-spread - and popular - sport in the Wokingham 
      area, not least because most of the hunting territory is now either 
      built-on or bisected by the M4 and A329(M) motorways. </p>
      <p>The <strong><a 
      href="../WW1/WW1_main_page.htm">'Reading Mercury'</a> </strong> reported in 
      great detail on the activities of the <strong><a 
      href="../memories_garth.htm">Garth Hunt</a> </strong> during 
      the early and mid-20th century. In the early 1920s each meeting was 
      described in racy style by&nbsp;a correspondent named<strong> <a 
      href="memories_wryneck.htm">'Wryneck'</a> 
      </strong>, and throughout the 
      1920s <strong>'Hunting Notes'</strong> 
      rivalled football in terms of column inches. No doubt there were many 
      readers who followed the Hunt from their firesides. Gradually <strong><a 
      href="#Dissent">voices of dissent</a></strong>        
                   
                 
               
                  
                 
       began to be heard, but generally the Hunt was welcomed wherever it met. </p>
      <p>In 1933 the Garth Hunt could be seen not just on 
      the edges of Wokingham but on two occasions right by the Town Hall. The 
      first <strong>'Town Hall meeting'</strong> was on <strong>Easter 
      Monday</strong>, but most of the activity took place in and around 
      <strong>Woosehill</strong>, <strong>Bearwood</strong>, 
      <strong>Arborfield</strong> and <strong>Longmoor</strong>,&nbsp;as 
      described <strong><a href="#Easter">here</a></strong>           
                    
                   
                . </p>
      <p> The second 'Town Hall meeting' was on 
      <strong>Boxing Day</strong>, a Tuesday morning when crowds massed around 
      the centre of the town, along its streets and out along the country lanes 
      now occupied by housing estates. However, before Christmas Day, the Garth 
      Hunt met twice. The first meet was&nbsp;on&nbsp;Friday 22nd December at 
      <strong>Winchcome</strong> near Basingstoke (attended by well-known local 
      families the <strong><a 
      href="memories_Garth_WWII.htm">Sturges</a></strong>, <strong><a 
      href="../families_simonds.htm">Simonds</a></strong> and 
      <strong><a href="../WW1/WW1_anti_vermin_garments.htm">Vere 
      Allfreys</a> </strong>), starting at<strong><em> 'Winchfield 
      House, the residence of Colonel Roland Charrington and Mrs. R. 
      Charrington, who hospitably entertained a large party'</em></strong>. The 
      next day, on Saturday 23rd December, the Garth met at <strong>Amen 
      Corner</strong> and after a foray to <strong>Easthampstead</strong> it 
      reached the outskirts of Wokingham as described      below: </p>
      <p>      "...he [the fox] crossed the railway [from 
      Easthampstead] into the <strong>Buckhurst covers</strong>, and hounds ran 
      with a charming burst of music for a while, and then came back into the 
      <strong>Big Wood</strong> again. <strong><em>A train came along and very 
      obligingly stopped in the Big Wood twice</em></strong>, but hounds could 
      never make anything of their fox afterwards." </p>
      <p>      Luckily, the railway line wasn't electrified until 
      1939, and engine drivers obeyed protocol. This <strong>OS one-inch 
      map</strong> from the late 1940s shows <strong>'Big Wood'</strong> to the 
      south of <strong>London Road</strong>, with Plough Lane to the west of 
      <strong>'Beanoak Farm'</strong>         , and very few 
      houses outside the centre of      Wokingham: </p>

      <p align="center"><strong><font size="4">THE POPULARITY 
      OF FOX-HUNTING.</font></strong>       </p>
      <p>      The Garth lady pack met on Boxing Day at 
      the<strong> Market Square, Wokingham</strong>, at 11 o’clock. At the meet 
      and out during the day were Mr. R. H. R. Palmer, the joint Master, Mrs. 
      Palmer, Lieut.-Col. F. G. Barker, Miss Effie Barker, the Misses 
      Williamson, Mr. John Simonds, Miss E. Simonds, Miss Mary Simonds, Mr. M. 
      Simonds, Mr. Vivian Simonds, Mrs. Rose, Mrs. Vere Allfrey, Miss E. 
      Allfrey, Mr. Pitman, Miss Henderson, Capt. Fuller, Mrs. Fuller, Major 
      Tanner, Mrs. Tanner, Mr. Oliver Dixon, Mr. R. Studley, Mr. R. E. 
      Sparshatt, Mr. W. Turner, Mr. Amschel, Mrs. Amschel, the Lady Victoria 
      Villiers, Miss West, Mr. Sherwood, Mr. and Mrs. Broadley, Mr. S. Smith, 
      Capt. H. Chinnock (ex-Master), Mrs. And Miss Harrison, Major Sweetman, 
      Mrs. E. M. Sturges, Capt. Sturges, Mr. Guy Hargreaves, Miss June 
      Hargreaves, Mr. Hazel, Miss hazel, Major Croker, Miss Croker, Misses 
      Croker and many      others. </p>
      <p>      The Boxing Day meet at Wokingham always means a 
      big crowd, but this year the record was beaten. Nearly all the streets in 
      the town were crowded, and the sides lined with cars. This was not only in 
      the town, but extended more or less for two miles out of the town on al 
      roads, especially towards the<strong> Warren House</strong>. In fact, the 
      greater part of the riders did not come into the town to the meet, but 
      were waiting outside. This enormous crowd of people proves how popular fox 
      hunting is, and no doubt most of the packs in England were attended in the 
      same spirit. It may convince the objectors that the majority of people 
      uphold and support the good old sport of      fox-hunting. </p>
      <p>      It has been said that fox-hunting is the sport of 
      the rich, but it is to-day the sport of all classes of the community and 
      likely to remain so while its popularity seems to increase. The Garth are 
      an especially favoured pack. They have the honour of having <strong>His 
      Majesty the King</strong> as their patron, and a subscriber. The Garth 
      have been commonly called the Royal pack, having been much patronised by 
      royalty. </p>
      <p>      About 11:20 <strong>Mr. Palmer</strong> gave 
      orders for moving off, and one blast of the huntsman’s horn cleared the 
      road to enable them to pass through <strong>Broad Street</strong> to the 
      <strong>Hurst road</strong> to draw the <strong>Holt</strong>, and round 
      <strong>Glebelands</strong>. Hounds were then taken round by <strong>Keep 
      Hatch</strong>, and found a fox in a hedgerow in the open near <strong>Mr. 
      de Vitre’s</strong>; they ran him through <strong>Pebblestone</strong>, 
      and across by the gravel pits close to the <strong>Warren House</strong>, 
      but he was headed off from crossing the road, and turned back and 
      proceeded over the road by <strong>Ashridge wood</strong>, across the 
      point-to-point course by <strong>Ashridge farm</strong> on to 
      <strong>Matthews Green</strong>, where he ran hounds out of scent after 
      quite a nice      hunt. </p>
      <p>      Hounds were then brought back from 
      <strong>Matthews Green</strong> and drew all through<strong> Keep 
      Hatch</strong> covers, and then round by <strong>Bean Oak farm</strong>, 
      and the <strong>Cocked Hat</strong> and across to 
      <strong>Blackmans</strong> and <strong>Pockets</strong>, where a fox was 
      found, which did not hurry to break cover. Eventually he broke across for 
      <strong>Top Copse</strong>, and then turned right-handed across the 
      meadows through the <strong>Gorse</strong> and <strong>Long 
      Copse</strong>, and across by <strong>Marchfields</strong> and 
      <strong>Tippings</strong>, going on into <strong>Pond Wood</strong> and 
      out into the road. He would have crossed into 
      <strong>Ashridge-wood</strong>, but was headed, and turned back through 
      <strong>Pine Wood</strong> and through <strong>Tippings</strong>, and on 
      to the shrubbery at <strong>Forest Lodge</strong>, where we left      him. </p>
      <p>      Later at <strong>Beech Wood</strong> a brace of 
      foxes were on foot. Hounds ran one over to <strong>North Hackett</strong> 
      and back to <strong>Beech Wood</strong> again, and, after hunting round a 
      considerable time, the fox crossed into <strong>Ashridge-wood</strong>. 
      Hounds finished up the day at <strong>Ashridge-wood</strong>      . </p>

              <b>Voices of Dissent:</b> </p>
      <p>        
      There had been sporadic outbursts in the Letters Page before and 
      during 1933 against animal cruelty, particularly on the subject of vivisection. </p>
      <p> On&nbsp;10th February 1934, after a 
      few more weeks of <strong>'Hunting Notes'</strong>, a <strong>reader's 
      letter</strong> was published complaining 
      about the cruelty of fox-hunting. This provoked two letters in favour of 
      fox-hunting on 17th February, then two in favour and two against on 24th February. 
      Most of those in favour&nbsp;questioned whether the dissenters had ever been 
      fox-hunting, or whether they were - perish the thought - 'vegetarians'.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>      On 3rd March there were five letters, mostly in 
      favour; the following week, on 10th March there were another four, plus 
      two more held over due to lack of space. These letters were printed on 
      17th March, whereupon the correspondence was declared 'closed'. </p>

      <p>The Garth lady pack met on Easter Monday at the 
      <strong>Town Hall, Wokingham</strong>. At the meet and out during the day 
      were Mr. R. H. R. Palmer, the joint Master, Mr. Murlees, Lieut.-Col. F. G. 
      Barker, ex-Master, Mr. E. M. Sturges, Mrs. E. M. Sturges, Mr. John

      others.</p>
      <p>Hounds were taken by <strong>Scott’s farm</strong> 
      to the <strong>Fox Hill</strong>, and into<strong> Bear Wood</strong>, and 
      soon found a fox in the rhododendrons and covers in Bear Wood park, and 
      eventually marked a fox to ground. They hunted another fox round the 
      rhododendrons, and eventually pushed him away across the park and over the 
      road to the <strong>Carter’s Hill</strong> covers, and on by the 
      <strong>Gorse</strong> to <strong>Arborfield Church</strong>. After 
      circling round they came back to the church, crossed the river, ran 
      towards <strong>Sindlesham</strong> and back by the osier beds through the 
      <strong>Carter’s Hill</strong> covers, and over to the 
      <strong>Holt</strong> [which 
      is&nbsp;in Sindlesham, not          
                    
                   
                 
                     
                  
                  
                   
                    
                      
                   
                    
                   
                  the one

      Wokingham].</p>
      <p>Hounds hunted him through this cover, and he broke 
      away into the meadow, but was headed, and turned away at the lower end of 
      the Holt, back to the covers near the osier bed. He came back again, 
      however, close by <strong>Mr. Dimond’s house</strong> and into the Holt 
      once more. Hounds checked for a time, but were <em>holloaed</em> on to the 
      line again, and ran on through the meadows to <strong>Mr. Holdstock’s 
      gorse</strong>, and on to <strong>Arborfield Hall farm</strong>          
                    
                   
                 
                     
                  
                  
                   
                    
                      
                   
                    
                   
            . It is probable the fox crossed the 
      river          
                  
                    
                 
               
                
                 
                  
                   
                    
      again.</p>
      <p>Hounds were then taken to 
      <strong>Kidgham</strong>, where about four foxes were on foot. Hounds 
      hunted round the cover for a time, changing from one fox to another. 
      Eventually, they got one fox away, ran him over to 
      <strong>Longmoor</strong>        
                   
                   
          and killed
