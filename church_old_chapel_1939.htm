  </font></font></b><font size="2">
  <p>Those who know the beautiful old ruined church of <b>St. Bartholomew</b>, 
  which lies in a<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The old church and chapel, 1939" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/new/old_church_1939.jpg" width="372" height="290"> 
  secluded corner of <b>Arborfield Park</b>, will be interested to hear that, 
  although the Victorian memorial chapels adjacent to the ruin are to be pulled 
  down very shortly, efforts are being made to strengthen and preserve the older 
  remains.</p>
  <p>Only a few records of Arborfield’s history have come down to us through the 
  mists of time. At one time the church was a chapel of Sonning, and in 1220 it 
  is described as being built of wood and in a ruinous condition. A remarkable 
  incident is recorded two years later when it was found that an old priest from 
  Reading, said to be blind as well as infirm, who was serving the chapel, was 
  found not to know a complete word of either the Gospel or the Canon of the 
  Mass. Needless to say, he was forbidden to officiate. It must have been soon 
  after this occurrence that the chapel now in ruins was built.</p>
  <p>This served the needs of the parish for nearly six hundred years until the 
  middle of the last century, when, as it was rapidly becoming ruinous, it was 
  decided to build the new church, also dedicated to St. Bartholomew, which now 
  stands on a prominence some eight or nine hundred yards away. The work was 
  completed in 1863, when the roof of the old church was removed. The bells and 
  some monuments and other fittings were removed to the new church, and already 
  the finest, a large marble tomb with life-sized marble figures of <b>
  <a href="families_Standen.htm">William Standen and Maria, his wife</a></b>, 
  who died in 1639, has found a resting place just within the main door of the 
  new church, to which position it was removed earlier this year. An old door 
  with original ironwork probably dating from the 14<sup>th</sup> century will 
  also be preserved, and will be used when a new vestry is erected. All the 
  other fittings are modern.</p>
  </font><b>
  <p align="center"><font size="3">Excavation Work</font></p>
  </b><font size="2">
  <p>The preservation of the ruins will include some excavation work and the 
  pointing and cementing of the walls. Efforts will also be made to preserve 
  some of the old wall paintings which decorate the splay of the main window. 
  The removal of the ivy may disclose architectural features such as a sandstone 
  piscina, three sedilla, an aumbry which have, hitherto, remained concealed.</p>
  <p>The work is being supervised by <b>Mr. C. B. Willcocks, F.S.A., of Reading</b>, 
  who is well known for his efforts in saving old Berkshire buildings and local 
  history recording. One of the main glories of the old church was the glass in 
  the window above the altar, which represented Moses and Aaron holding the two 
  tablets of the law. This glass was made by a celebrated local craftsman, <b>
  John Rowell</b>, who lived in the earlier part of the eighteenth century and 
  died in 1756. He is supposed to have re-discovered the wonderful red which is 
  a conspicuous feature of early mediaeval work, but the secret is supposed to 
  have died with him. Unhappily, the window was broken in 1863, and only the 
  upper portion of Aaron with a small fragment of the red glass in a corner of 
  the robe is yet preserved in a window of the new church, where its vivid 
  colours make a striking contrast to the subdued tones of the more modern 
  windows. Here, too, is preserved the old wooden font, an almost unique 
  feature, but some mediaeval patterned tiles have found their way to the 
  Reading Museum, where one is at present displayed in the local room with 
  others from nearby sites.</p>
  <p>Actually the removal of the modern chapels will, if anything, enhance the 
  charm of the old ruin and its surroundings, and, no doubt, many interesting 
  relics of the older building will be recovered when the work is taken in hand.</p>
