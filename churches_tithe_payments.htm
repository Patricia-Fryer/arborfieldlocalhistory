  <b>From the Arborfield Parish Tithe Accounts book covering the period from 
  1854 to 1922:</b><p>Inside front cover: ‘Last time <b>Mr Cooper</b> paid Tithe 
  for <b>Kenney’s Farm</b>, Nov 7<sup>th</sup> 1865’.</p>
  <p>Front page: <b>Tithe Days</b> were held at the <b>
  <a href="properties_bull.htm">Bull Inn</a></b> from 1854 to 1867, in November 
  or December, usually with <b>Dinner at 5 o’clock</b>. The records stated that
  <b>T Tubb</b> was landlord from 1854 to 1858, then <b>Mrs Matthews</b> on to 
  1867.</p>
  <p>The annual Accounts listed <b>Occupiers</b> on the left-hand column, the <b>
  Proprietors</b> in the second column, and the <b>values and accounts</b> in 
  the next three columns. There doesn’t seem to be an easy cross-reference to 
  actual land holdings on the Tithe Map. However, we can identify certain of the 
  properties such as farms and pubs, and dates where key names changed:</p>
  <p><b>John Allwright</b> was Proprietor of some land in Arborfield Parish, and
  <b>J Simonds</b> was the Occupier – probably this holding included the land on 
  which the old <b><a href="churches_dissenters.htm">Dissenters’ Chapel</a></b> 
  once stood. In 1868, the Proprietor was ‘<b>late Allwright’s; Himself</b>’ – perhaps 
  it was taken over by John Simonds.</p>
  <p>By the 1870’s, <b>Cordery’s</b>, <b>Holworth’s</b> and <b>
  Mott’s</b> farms were mentioned. </p>
  <p>In 1885, the list included <b>Home Farm</b>, <b>White’s Farm</b>, <b>
  Tanner’s Farm</b>, <b>G W’s Farm </b>– later identified as <b>Bartlett’s Farm</b>. 
  All were owned by <b>Sir George Russell</b> [of Swallowfield].</p>
  <p>In 1889, we find: <b>Mr J &amp; R M Wells</b>, New Farm; <b>Mr Isaacs</b>, 
  Bartlett’s Farm; <b>Mr Cordery</b>, White’s Farm; <b>Sir Geo. Russel</b>l, 
  Tanner’s Farm and Home Farm.</p>
  <p>In 1891, <b>Wells</b> occupied New Farm, <b>Churchill</b> occupied 
  Bartletts, but others weren’t identified. However, in 1892, <b>Cordery</b> was 
  listed at White’s. By 1893, <b>Mr Chown</b> occupied Hall Farm, while in 1894,
  <b>Mr R Wells</b> took on Cross Lane Farm, and in the same year <b>Mr Kelly</b> 
  had become Landlord of <b><a href="properties_Bramshill_Hunt.htm">The 
  Bramshill Hunt</a></b>.</p>
  <p>The 1895 list showed <b>Mr Lewis</b> at White’s Farm, <b>J &amp; R Wells</b> at 
  New Farm, and <b>Miss Radbourn</b> at The Bull. </p>
  <p>By 1896, the list became more comprehensive: <b>J &amp; R Wells</b>, New Farm;
  <b>Mr Nash</b>, Bartlett’s; <b>Mr Cordery</b>, Ducks Nest; <b>Mr Lewis</b>, 
  White’s; <b>Sir Geo.Russell</b>, Tanner’s and Home; while <b>Mr Gatley</b> was 
  at Hall Farm.</p>
  <p>In 1898, <b><a href="properties_x_lanes_farm.htm">R Wells</a></b> was still at Cross Lane Farm. By 1899, <b>
  <a href="WW1/WW1_Butler.htm">Mr Dymott</a></b> (butler at Arborfield Hall) 
  occupied Church Cottage, while <b>Mrs Hargreaves</b> took over Hall Farm 
  herself. </p>
  <p>There were some minor changes in the early 1900’s: in 1901, <b>Mr ‘Holdway’</b> 
  was at New Farm; in 1902, <b>Mr Deane</b> took over Duck’s Nest; in 1903, <b>R 
  Hewett Esq.</b> became tenant of Langley Farm and <b>Mr ‘Holliday’ </b>was at 
  New Farm. There was more change in 1905, with <b>John Simonds</b> at Langley 
  Farm and <b>Mr Parfitt</b> at New Farm.</p>
  <p>An additional note in 1906 recorded that John Simonds had sold pieces of 
  land ref. 206, 207, 208, 209, 210 and 211 to <b>Mrs Bruce</b>. This land 
  eventually became <b>Arborfield Court</b>.</p>
  <p>In 1907, <b>Mr Lucas</b> was at Cross Lane Farm, and in 1908, <b>Mr 
  Stephenson</b> was listed at Bartlett’s, while <b>Mr Lucas</b> additionally 
  took on Langley Farm.</p>
  <p>A new occupier in 1907 was the <b>‘Army Remount Depot’</b> on <b>Arthur 
  Walter’s</b> land. <b>Miss Radborn</b> was still at The Bull, by now owned by 
  Blandy Hawkins &amp; Co.</p>
  <p>In 1910, <b>Mr Rayne</b>r was at The Bull, and the Army Remount Depot was 
  on land held by the Executors of Arthur Walter, but for the next year, the 
  owner was <b>John Walter</b>, before the <b>War Office</b> took ownership in 
  1912.</p>
  <p>Farms continued to change tenants – <b>Mr Currach</b> at White’s and <b>Mr 
  Hedges</b> at Hall Farm in 1911; <b>Mr Broadway</b> at Bartletts in 1912, 
  while The Bull was occupied by <b>Mr Dovey</b> in 1913, but only for a year.</p>
  <p>By Winter 1914, the world was a different place; <b>Mr Kearse</b> was at 
  Bartlett’s, <b>Mr Bryant</b> at Duck’s Nest and <b>
  <a href="WW1/families_bushell.htm">Mr Bushell </a></b>began a long reign at 
  The Bull.</p>
  <p>The Bull changed owners in 1916 when the <b>South Berks Brewery Co</b>. was 
  mentioned for the first time.</p>
  <p>Bartlett’s again changed tenants in 1919 when <b>Mr Hoskyns</b> took up 
  residence. In 1922 there were some more changes, when <b>Mr Rogers</b> was at 
  White’s, <b>C W Crocker</b> was at Cross Lane, and <b>Mr Hutchins</b> was at 
  Tanner’s Farm, which was by then owned by <b>Captain Body</b>. </p>
