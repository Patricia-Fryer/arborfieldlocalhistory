        <b>Reading Mercury, Saturday June 6<sup>th</sup> 1953</b></p>
        <p><b>ARBORFIELD</b></p>
        <p>On Thursday last week Arborfield School celebrated the Coronation 
        with a display of dancing, singing, physical training and a fancy dress 
        parade. Commemoration trees, presented by Mrs. Simonds, were planted by 
        Mrs. Simonds and Mrs. Howard Jones, who were later presented with 
        bouquets and souvenir trowels. Before leaving, each child was given an 
        engraved beaker. </p>
        <p>Coronation Day itself opened with an open-air service conducted by 
        the Rev. J. F. A. Wicksteed in the British Legion field. This was 
        followed by the televising of the Coronation ceremony for 100 old age 
        pensioners at The Swan, by permission of Mr. Durling. </p>
        <p>The chief event of the afternoon was the fancy dress parade, which 
        assembled in the village street, and in which "Guardsman" E. Middleton 
        was a topical winner in the vehicle section with his replica of Windsor 
        Castle. After judging by Mr. and Mrs. Fleming, the parade moved off to 
        the British Legion field, headed by an amateur band dressed in assorted 
        costumes, and armed with equally assorted instruments. Here children’s 
        sports were organised, and after tea at the Village Hall there were 
        adult sports, and a Ladies V. Gentlemen cricket match. </p>
        <p>The evening concluded with an open-air broadcast of the speech by Her 
        Majesty the Queen, followed by a firework display and a bonfire 
        organised by the Boy Scouts.</p>
        <p>First-Prize winners were:</p>
        <p>Best decorated house, Mrs. Brown, Emblen Crescent; <br>large garden, A. 
        Jarvis; <br>small garden, R. Hamblin;</p>
        <p>Fancy-dress: <br>Children (group), Nursery Rhyme: David, Ian, Christopher 
        Inglis; <br>Children (individual): John Bull, David Newport; <br>Adult (group) 
        Family: Mesdames Aitchison, Allen, Bell, Kent; <br>Adult (individual): 
        Fortune Teller, Mrs. Gutteridge.</p>
        <p>Children’s races: <br>Boys under 5: Jimmy Wilkinson. <br>Mixed, 5-7: Leslie 
        Totton. <br>Girls, 7-10: Margaret Saunders. <br>Boys 7-10: Graham Wootton. <br>Girls 
        10-12: J. Barr. <br>Boys 10-12: J. Patterson. <br><br>Egg and Spoon: <br>under 5: Mervyn 
        Saunders. <br>5-7: Linda Rickard. <br>Girls, 12-15: Clare Borgins. 
        <br>Boys, 12-15: M. Long.</p>
        <p><b>BARKHAM</b></p>
        <p>On Sunday Barkham Church was filled with a congregation which 
        included 500 troops from the garrison, at a service conducted by the 
        Rev. C. C. Roycroft.</p>
        <p>In order not to compete with adjoining villages the main celebrations 
        were held on Monday evening, but were sadly marred by the weather. 
        However, a fancy-dress parade was held and later marched through the 
        village headed by 14 Gordon Boys’ Pipers, and this was followed by 
        fireworks and a bonfire. </p>
        <p>To commemorate the occasion old age pensioners are being presented 
        with a picture of the Queen and a perpetual calendar, while school 
        children will have a replica of the anointing spoon. Winners of the 
        adult fancy-dress were Mr. and Mrs. Wilkinson.</p>
