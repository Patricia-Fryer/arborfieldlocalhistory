<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb"><br><b>Ernest Bowyer</b> was for a long 
time associated with <b>Newland Farm</b>, near Arborfield Cross, but he had 
originally been at Arborfield Hall Farm. The Kelly's Directory of 1907 described 
him as '<b><i>farmer &amp; farm bailiff to Mrs. S. Hargreaves, Hall Farm</i></b>', 
which he had been since at least 1901.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">The 1901 Census traces 28-year-old 
Ernest back to <b>Warfield</b>, and his 27-year-old wife <b>Annie</b> to 
Woodley. Son <b>Frank</b> was aged 1, while his sister <b>Kathleen</b> was only 
3 months old. <b>Charles</b> and <b>Howard</b> were born in 1902 and 1904. By 
1910 Ernest had moved to <b>Mungells Farm, King Street, Winnersh</b>, but the 
family continued to worship at Arborfield where his daughter <b>Mabel</b> was 
baptised. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb">By at least 1922, Ernest was farming at 
Newland, as the <b><a href="../newlandcouncil.htm">Newland Parish Council 
Minutes</a></b> show. </span><span lang="EN-GB">
<font size="2">
In 1923, the Chairman John Simonds had raised the 
question of the rubbish being dumped by the Villagers, "at the end of Coombes 
Lane" (actually Coles Lane), near his cottages. He stated that he understood 
that the rubbish was being deposited in such a manner that it was becoming an 
obstruction.&nbsp; <b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Mr Ernest Bowyer,&nbsp; a councillor and the tenant of 
Newland Farm</span></b>,&nbsp; supported this statement and mentioned that on one 
occasion when he was sending his carts down the Lane he had to send a man to 
throw the rubbish back,&nbsp;before they could go past. </font></span><span lang="en-gb">We know 
more of Ernest's time at 
Newland Farm from the <b><a href="memories_LHRS_8.htm">Local History Recording 
Scheme</a></b>, which describes changes at the farm between 1940 and the 1950s. </span></p>

<font size="2">
<p>September 7th 1940: <b>Presentation to Mr. E. Bowyer</b> – On Wednesday a 
pleasing ceremony took place at the Village Hall when Mr. J. H. Simonds 
presented an armchair to Mr. Bowyer, subscribed for by 101 parishioners and 
friends. Canon Anderson presided. There were also present: Mrs. Anderson, Mrs. 
Simonds, Mrs. Bowyer, Miss A. M. Edwards, Mrs. S. G. Bentley, Mr. G. St. Clare 
Collis, Mr. W. J. Verrall, Mr. W. T. Cox, Mr. Foster and others.</p>
<p>The chairman said that they had met for the purpose of expressing in some 
tangible form an appreciation of the services rendered to the church as <b>
warden</b> by Mr. Bowyer during the years 1907-10, 1922-27 and 1929 till he left 
in the spring to reside at <b>Arborcot</b>, Whatmore Lane [sic], Hurst. The 
rector stated that in Mr. Bowyer he had found a friend and wise counsellor, who 
had helped him so much in church and parish. To Mrs. Bowyer, too, he was most 
grateful for her help and interest on so many <b>occasions</b>. </p>
<p><b>Mr. J. H. Simonds</b>, in making the presentation, said that he felt proud 
to do so, for they were very much indebted to Mr. Bowyer ever since he came from
<b>Hurst</b> – the mother parish – to live amongst them. His heart had been in 
the work and welfare of the church and village, for he had been a <b>school 
manager</b>, a member of both the <b>parish</b> and <b>district</b> <b>councils</b>, 
as well as a <b>trustee of the Hurst Parochial Charities</b>. He also thanked <b>
Mrs. Bowyer</b> for all she had done. The volume containing the names of 101 
contributors was handed to Mr. Bowyer by Mrs. S. G. Bentley. In accepting the 
gift, Mr. Bowyer said that what he had done for the church and the parish had 
been a labour of love.</p>
