<p>It was widely feared that Reading would be badly hit by bomb attacks because 
of its prominence as a transport centre. In the event, this didn't happen, 
though a daylight raid caused much death and destruction. Berkshire also escaped 
heavy bomb damage. </p>

<p>It is said that <b>Goering</b>, who had visited <b>Bramshill House</b> in the 1930s, 
wanted to claim it as a residence in the event that the U.K. became under 
occupation. Perhaps this afforded central Berkshire some relief from bomb 
attacks - though <b>Woodley</b> was hit, and according to the <b>
<a href="memories_LHRS_9.htm">Local History Recording Scheme's War Diary</a></b>, 
a few bombs were dropped on <b>Arborfield</b> but without any fatalities. A <b>
<a href="../properties_hall_decoy.htm">decoy site on Arborfield Hall Farm</a></b> 
was manned for many years under great secrecy - and therefore it escaped any 
mention in local news reports. </p>

<p>During the war, the newspapers were careful not to give too much away, as the 
following articles from the 'Reading Mercury' show.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on May 8th 1943, it revealed: </p>

<p align="center"><b>The Raid on Reading</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Town Hall and a Church Damaged</b> </p>
</font><font size="2">
<p><i>The Home Counties town, victim of a tip-and-run raid, was Reading, it can 
now be revealed. Bombs fell in the centre of town, causing considerable damage, 
and a number of casualties. Many were seriously injured. Children were among the 
victims. […] One of Reading’s oldest churches, St. Laurence’s, was damaged.</i>
</p>
<p>[This must have been rather obvious to anyone walking through Reading town 
centre....]</p>

<p>From mid-June 1944 onwards, there were several reports of ‘pilotless planes’ 
arriving in the area; one pilot from Reading had shot down five of them. The 
Reading Mercury in 1944 never called them ‘Doodlebugs’ or V1’s.</p>
<p>The 'Mercury' for March 24th 1945 showed photo of <b>‘Cottages Damaged by 
Bomb</b>: Shortly after a V-Bomb dropped in a rural area of Southern England, 
workmen are busy repairing these cottages damaged by blast.' A separate news 
article stated that a few people were injured but no deaths.</p>

<p>On May 12th, the 'Mercury' reported: <b>‘How VE-Day was celebrated in the 
District’</b>. There were photos of celebrations, plus two photos of wartime 
incidents: </p>
<p>‘The bombing of the People’s Pantry at Reading on February 10<sup>th</sup> 
1943, when many were killed and injured’:</p>

        On June 2nd, the 'Mercury' was able to state the extent of bombing in 
        the county of Berkshire (excluding Reading, which was administered 
        separately as a County Borough):</p>
       
<font size="3"><b>
<p align="center">Bombs on Berkshire</b> 
      </p>
</font><font size="2">
<p><i>The Berkshire County A.R.P. Officer has reported: </i> </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>From the commencement of the war until the end of June 1940, the county 
  escaped any enemy attention, though the sirens were sounded for one or two 
  alerts. </i>
  <li><i>Between July 1940 and May 1941 some 1,595 bombs and many incendiaries were 
  dropped in the county. </i>
  <li><i>After May 1941 only occasional small attacks, totalling 115 bombs, were 
  experienced, the last of these being April 1944. </i>
  <li><i>Between June and the end of 1944, a dozen flying bombs, and in March 1945, 
  a long range rocket, fell in the county.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>The number of casualties was: Fatal: 43; serious, 96; slight, 181. </i> </p>
<p><i>Five enemy aeroplanes were reported to have been destroyed in the county.
</i> </p>
<p><i>The total number of bombs dropped was 1,710, of which 1,595 were H.E., 105 
were oil bombs, and 10 were parachute mines. In addition, there were 54 
occasions when falls of the 1 kgr. incendiary bombs were recorded, and these 
numbered several thousand in all, though no attempt was made to count them 
accurately.</i></p>
<p><i>The fall of bombs by years was as follows: </i> </p>
<p><i>1940: 1,310; <br>1941: 296; <br>1942: 21; <br>1943: 11; <br>1944: 72. </i>  </p>
<p><i>The fall by county 
districts was: </i>  </p>
<p><i>Wokingham, 236;<br> Easthampstead, 224; <br>Newbury, 200; <br>Maidenhead, 
190; <br>Windsor Borough, 177; <br>Bradfield, 175; <br>Abingdon, 164; <br>Faringdon, 95; <br>Windsor 
Rural District, 88; <br>Hungerford, 74; <br>Wallingford, 52; <br>Wantage, 35.
</i></p>
<p><i>No complete county record of the damage is at present available.</i></p>
