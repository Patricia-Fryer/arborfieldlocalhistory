        <i><b><font size="4">"Squatters" and Hut-Dwellers</font></b></i></p>

        <p>For <b>Wokingham Rural District Council </b>(W.R.D.C.), 1946 began 
        with great hopes for new council housing, but it had trouble getting 
        permission to build by the Government. Even private builders couldn’t 
        get building licences, because there were many shortages that were to 
        persist for some years yet. To take one example, although the brickworks 
        at <b>Knowl Hill</b> and <b>Arborfield </b>were bursting with orders, 
        even they weren’t allowed to build temporary houses for their workers.</p>
        <p>The <b>‘Times and Weekly News’</b> of 7<sup>th</sup> June reported on
        <b>W.R.D.C.</b>’s housing progress: <b>Arborfield &amp; Newland</b> were 
        planned to get 30 houses in the first two years after the war (but as it 
        turned out, they didn’t get them until after 1950); <b>Hurst</b> 46; <b>
        Winnersh</b> 22; <b>Wokingham Without</b> 12. In subsequent years, <b>
        Barkham</b> would get 30; <b>Finchampstead</b> 60; <b>Winnersh</b> 8 and
        <b>Wokingham Without</b> 16. There was no mention in this report of <b>
        Woodley </b>or <b>Earley</b>. (A later report on Earley mentioned that 
        it was expecting to get its housing via private enterprise.)</p>
        <p>In May 1946, W.R.D.C. had issued a compulsory purchase order for a 
        field off <b>School Road</b>, farmed by <b>Mr. Wade Isaacs</b> of 
        Langley Pond Farm, Barkham, to be 
        the site for new Council houses. Mr. Isaacs wanted to get on with his 
        farming that year, and he prevented Council officials from walking on 
        his crops, delaying surveying work. The following year, the Council 
        stopped Mr. Isaacs from planting new crops so that they could get on 
        with their job.</p>
        <p>The Council had setbacks elsewhere; they wanted to build off <b>King 
        Street Lane</b> in <b>Winnersh</b>, but had to scale back the size of 
        the site in mid-1946 because a new trunk road was being planned between
        <b>London and South Wales</b> (As it happened, the <b>
        <a href="properties_motorways.htm">M4</a></b> wasn’t built through 
        Winnersh for another quarter of a century).</p>
        <p>In the nearby towns, <b>Reading</b> and <b>Wokingham</b> Borough 
        Councils tried their best to speed up the flow, both putting up their 
        first ‘pre-fabs’ in 1946 (<b>Whitley</b> in January, and <b>Binfield 
        Road </b>in November), but it wasn’t fast enough to satisfy demand. 
        Soldiers were being de-mobbed and young families were looking for 
        somewhere to live. There was desperate overcrowding.</p>
        <p>By August 1946, some people started taking matters into their own 
        hands, <b>‘squatting’</b> in empty properties up and down the country, 
        mostly in Army camps. All over Berkshire, sites were being commandeered, 
        much against the wishes of central and local Government. </p>
        <p>Reading Council threatened those who’d occupied the <b>Anti-Aircraft 
        Battery camp in Northumberland Road</b> with removal from the housing 
        waiting list if they didn’t vacate within a month. Wokingham Borough 
        Council was more successful in evicting three families of squatters from
        <b>Toutley Depot</b>, so that 10 huts could be allocated to people on 
        the housing list. <b>Henley Council</b> had also been pro-active; at <b>
        Dry Lees in Henley</b>, they arranged for troops to clear huts for 
        squatters, linking 42 ‘Elephant’ Nissen Huts to services. </p>
        <p>There were 50 families at the Northumberland Avenue site; the 
        ‘Reading Standard’ of 30<sup>th</sup> August carried three photos of 
        people occupying the Nissen Huts there. The ‘Reading Mercury’ of 31<sup>st</sup> 
        August reported on Lord Portal’s generosity at <b>Foxdown Camp, Overton</b>, 
        which he had bought from the Bank of England and presented to Whitchurch 
        District Council. Other articles in the same issue recorded squatters at
        <b>Heckfield</b> (25 families) and at <b>Odiham</b>.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of September, a deputation from Northumberland 
        Avenue met the Mayor of Reading, and efforts were being made to form a 
        Berkshire Federation of Squatters. Delegates from 8 camps representing 
        250 families met on the parade ground at <b>Ranikhet Camp in Tilehurst</b> 
        on Sunday 8<sup>th</sup> September. Apart from the two Reading camps, 
        there were squatters from <b>Theale</b>, <b>Upper Culham</b>, <b>
        Chaddleworth</b> and <b>Bucklebury Common</b>. </p>
        <p>The ‘Reading Mercury' had carried an illustrated article on the <b>
        Bucklebury</b> camp in its 24<sup>th</sup> August issue, and also 
        reported another successful ‘squat’ at <b>Dorchester</b>, while 5 
        families were frustrated in their attempt at <b>Greenham Common</b>. A 
        Squatters’ demonstration was held in Reading on Saturday 21<sup>st</sup> 
        September, with the organisers claiming that POW’s were being 
        looked-after better than the former British servicemen.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Both nationally and locally, demand was so great that by the end of 
        the year, some 40,000 people had joined ‘Squatters’ around the country. 
        By December, Ranihket Camp was being run by Reading Council (though by 
        1950 it was again in use by military, namely the Royal Army Pay Corps), and Bucklebury Common Camp was handed over to Bradfield Rural District 
        Council by the Army. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, squatters had occupied properties around <b>Arborfield</b>. 
        By early September, seven families squatted in <b>
        <a href="properties_squatters.htm">Barkham Manor</a></b> and 
        refused to budge. <b>W.R.D.C.’s Housing and Public Health Committee</b> 
        wondered what to do with them, because these families were soon to be 
        served with a High Court writ, and they would then be the Council’s 
        problem. In Arborfield, it was reported in the local paper that a few 
        families had squatted both in Arborfield Hall and in one of the 
        bungalows. As it turned out, only one building had been involved: the <b>
        Davis family</b> had occupied <b>East Lodge</b>.</p>
        <p>
        <img border="0" alt="American military vehicles outside Arborfield Hall during WWII" src ="images/Yanks2.jpg" width=575 height=349 ></p>
        <p>At its October 1946 meeting, the W.R.D.C. Housing and Public Health 
        Committee debated whether to take over <b>Arborfield Hall Camp</b>, 
        which had been originally been requisitioned by the War Department for 
        the R.A.F. and latterly for the U.S. Army, but was now redundant. The 
        Minutes state: </p>
        <p><i>"The Committee considered a report by the Surveyor on his 
        inspection of Arborfield Hall and the camp, in which he stated (inter 
        alia) he was of the same opinion regarding Arborfield Hall House was 
        previously reported by him in April last, viz: that this property was 
        unsuitable for conversion and adaptation for housing purposes, although 
        he now considered the cottage (at present occupied by the "Squatters") 
        should be taken over by the Council; further, that the huts are suitable 
        for conversion into 15 dwellings, each with living kitchen and two 
        bedrooms, at a roughly estimated cost of £100 per hut.</i></p>
        <p><i>"After discussion it was resolved that Mrs. Capper (the local 
        representative) be asked to inspect the premises and that subject to the 
        approval of the Ministry of Health being obtained to the expenditure to 
        be involved in carrying out minimum works to adapt the hutments for 
        living accommodation, the Surveyor be authorised to arrange for the work 
        to be put in hand, and the Council's Officials in consultation with Mrs. 
        Capper empowered to offer accommodation in the Arborfield Hall camp to 
        the "Squatters" in Barkham Manor in the event of the latter being 
        evicted by order of the Court."</i></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Before the meeting on 5<sup>th</sup> November, the Davis family had 
        been served notice to quit their bungalow at Arborfield Hall , but they 
        were to be offered a hut at the camp.</p>
        <p>The November Minutes reported that <i>"A quotation was received from 
        J. T. Cook &amp; Sons for £3,074 for carrying out the proposed works of 
        conversion to the hutments at Arborfield Hall Camp, and an additional 
        cost of £202/10/- and £200 for the cost of 27 ranges and provision of 
        water supply. Approval was given by the Ministry of Health on the 
        understanding that the Council are satisfied that there is a reasonable 
        prospect of all the 27 huts remaining occupied during the temporary 
        lifetime of the huts." </i></p>
        <p>Also, tentative proposals were presented for division of the Hall 
        into 6 self-contained flats with separate entrances at a cost of £1,250, 
        to be inspected and reported back. </p>
        <p>Haslams, agents for <b>Mrs. Allsebrook</b>, the owner of Arborfield 
        Hall, expressed dismay at the state the Army had left Arborfield Hall. 
        The Council speculated whether it would be worth buying the whole 
        property, but were put off by the £10,000 price tag. They continued to 
        rent it.</p>
        <p>The huts were ready for occupation by the 7<sup>th</sup> January 1947 
        meeting, and the most-needy folk were moved in first, from all over the 
        district. Some didn’t stay long; <b>Mrs. Brant</b> of Kiln Ride, 
        Wokingham, <b>Mr. Nun</b> of Barkham Ride, <b>Mr. Mackintyre</b> of Nine 
        Mile Ride, Finchampstead, and <b>Mr. Robbins</b>, also of Nine Mile 
        Ride, were only in the huts for about a month while their own cottages 
        were made habitable. However, others stayed for several years.</p>
        <p>The 7<sup>th</sup> January Minutes listed <b>11 detached Nissen Huts</b>: 
        2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 42, 43, 44, plus <b>14 detached prefabricated 
        Timber Huts</b>: 16, 17, 25, 26, 31 – 40, plus the <b>modern brick and 
        tile bungalow</b> (East Lodge). It was agreed to fence-off the bank of 
        the River Loddon as a safety measure.</p>
        <p>The 4<sup>th</sup> February meeting was told that East Lodge, 
        recently vacated by the Davis family (who’d moved to Hut 10), was to be 
        allocated to <b>Mr. J. Moore, Additional Sanitary Inspector</b>, who’d 
        been promised it on his appointment to the Council. </p>
        <p>At the 7<sup>th</sup> March meeting, the Committee was faced with 
        demands by tenants of the camps at <b>Wargrave</b> and <b>Arborfield </b>
        to lay out gardens and to grow vegetables. Even though this meant 
        digging up parkland at Arborfield, it was decided to fence-off gardens 
        and allow cultivation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The huts weren’t ideal; it was pointed out that the light switches 
        turned on or off all the lights at once. The Committee recommended 
        getting a quotation to re-wire the huts.</p>
        <p>By April 1947, the two flats at <b>Arborfield Hall</b> were about 
        ready for occupation. However, other parts of the mansion continued to 
        be affected by vandalism and theft of materials. By 1950, there was a 
        caravan site at the Camp, which provided room for a few more families.</p>
        <p>There was no pavement along the Reading Road or the Eversley Road 
        through the village, and so the families at the Camp needed to use the 
        buses to get to school. One couple who'd been on site since early 1947,
        <b>Henry and Lucy Hiscock</b>, of Hut 26, suffered a tragedy on St. 
        Valentine's Day in 1950. Their daughter <b><a href="memories_esme.htm">Esme</a></b> was on her way to 
        Arborfield Cross from the Camp, and was killed when crossing the road 
        after getting off the bus. As a result, the Parish Council pressed ever 
        harder for footpaths to improve road safety. </p>
        <p>The Data CD shows that several residents at the Camp from 1947 were 
        still there and were listed on the 1950 Electoral register. However, by 
        19<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Emblen Crescent from the air, 1985" vspace  =5 align=right src="images/Aerial/Emblen_Crescent_1985.jpg" width=375 height=251 >53, families 
        had moved into the new <b>‘Newland Estate’ off School Road</b>. The 
        first families moved in during 1951, when the first phase of 14 
        dwellings in Emblen Crescent, seen on the right, were completed.</p>
        <p>Not all of the new residents of <b>Anderson Crescent</b> and <b>
        Emblen Crescent </b>came from Arborfield Hall camp. Some had moved from 
        other parts of the village, especially from the <b>Council Houses in Eversley Road</b>, which had suffered for years from less than adequate 
        sewage disposal: their cesspits regularly overflowed, as reported at 
        several <b><a href="anpcouncil.htm">Parish Annual Meetings</a></b> in 
        the early post-war years.</p>
        <p>According to the 1953 Electoral register, all 20 houses in Anderson 
        Crescent and 20 out of the 22 in Emblen Crescent were occupied. Even at 
        this stage, eight families still lived in the huts at Arborfield Hall Camp, 
        including the Hiscocks.
        </p>
        <p>By the 1954 Electoral register (prepared in Autumn 1953), two huts at 
        Arborfield Hall Camp were still being occupied, but it was preparing for 
        closure. Arborfield Hall had been sold to the University of Reading, and the 
        Hall itself was demolished, to be replaced by a modern detached house. 
        Now there is no sign that so many families had made the Camp their home 
        for all those years.</p>
