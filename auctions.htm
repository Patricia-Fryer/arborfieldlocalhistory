<p class="stbody">Over the last hundred years or so, the large estates have been 
split up for various reasons, leaving only two major landowners:&nbsp; <b>Reading 
University</b> and <b>Farley Farms</b>.&nbsp; The Auction Sale documents give us a 
fascinating snapshot into life at the time of each sale.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b>Newlands</b> estate covered much of the centre of 
Arborfield Cross, and was originally sold in <b> <a href="A_N_1947.htm">1947</a></b>, but not all 
of the Lots were successfully sold. Another sale took place in <b>
<a href="A_N_1948.htm">1948</a></b>, and a third 
in <b> <a href="A_N_1952.htm">1952</a></b>. We are grateful to David Simonds and Henry Lee for the loan of the 
Sale documents. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b>Arborfield Hall</b> estate was offered for sale in <b>
<a href="Hall_Sale_1855.htm">1855</a></b> and again in <b>
<a href="Hall_Sale_1919.htm">1919</a></b>, <b><a href="Hall_Sale_1924.htm">1924</a></b> and 
<b><a href="Hall_Sale_1926.htm">1926</a></b>, and 
by 1919 it included property along Church Lane. The 
Church lost its Reading Room, which wasn't originally intended to have been put in the 
sales. A separate furniture sale was held in 1926, as advertised <b>
<a href="auctions_hall_furniture.htm">here</a></b>. </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Carter's Hill Farm</b> was sold in <b>
<a href="C_H_1919.htm">1919</a></b>. Most of the agricultural land is now owned by 
the University of Reading, while the buildings have been sold and in some cases converted into 
dwellings.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody">The <b>Bearwood</b> estate was gradually accumulated under
<strong>John Walter II</strong> and then <strong>John Walter III</strong> when 
the fortunes of 'The Times' newspaper were running high. By the time <strong>
Arthur Fraser Walter</strong> died in 1910, it covered a huge area of more than 
10 square miles including 
much of Nine Mile Ride south of Wokingham, but it was under pressure to be sold 
off to pay death duties. First, <strong><a href="BW_1911_outlying_portions.htm">
the 'outlying portions' were put up for auction in March 1911</a></strong>, 
leaving the <strong><a href="BW_1911_mansion_etc.htm">mansion, home farm and closer properties for a second 
auction in July 1911</a></strong>. However, not one of the five Lots in the second 
auction managed to reach its reserve price. The Walter family remained in the 
mansion until after the Great War when it was sold privately to the <strong>Royal Merchant 
Navy Orphanage</strong>. To the south-east,&nbsp; 
the land that became the <strong>Remount Depot</strong> and later <strong>
Arborfield Garrison</strong> had been leased from the Bearwood Estate in 1904, 
and eventually sold 
privately to the Government in 1911. The Auction Sale documents of <b>
<a href="BW_1911.htm">1911</a></b> give a large amount of information about the 
Estate at that time. A further sale of <strong>outlying portions of the Bearwood 
Estate</strong> took place in <strong><a href="BW_1912.htm">September 1912</a></strong>, 
but very few lots actually sold despite very favourable terms.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Arborfield Court</b> was sold in 1916, and a <b>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Court_Furniture_Auction.htm">Furniture Auction</a></b> was held 
in October. A year later, <b>Arborfield Grange</b> was sold in 1917, and its <b>
<a href="WW1/WW1_Grange_Auction.htm">Furniture Auction</a></b> was held in the 
summer.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Arborfield Grange</b> had been auctioned several times over 
the years; Reading Local Studies Library has 3 sets of sale documents: <b><a 
      href="C19/AG_1887.htm">1887</a>,
<a href="C20/AG_1914.htm">1914</a> <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">and</span> <a 
      href="C20/AG_1921.htm">1921</a> 
</b>. the last two with maps. All are reproduced here.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b>Swallowfield Park</b> owned much of the land to the south and west 
of the Cross including White's and Bartlett Farms and what is now Walden Avenue.&nbsp; 
This detached portion was offered for sale in 1913; many of the buildings still 
exist but many trees have since been felled.&nbsp; A large acreage is now owned by the Samuel family through their Farley Farms 
estate.&nbsp; </p> 
       
<p class="stbody">Note:&nbsp; The third major landowner in Arborfield Parish in 
the late 1900's was the Ministry of Defence, but it sold its land on the former
<b>Poperinghe Barracks</b> privately rather than by auction.&nbsp; The remaining 
part of what is known as 'Arborfield Garrison' is largely in Barkham Parish.</p> 
       
<p class="stbody"><b><a href="C20/families_Rowe.htm#Targetts_Farm_Auction">
Targett's Farm</a></b> was offered for sale in 1922 following the death of <b>
James Hellier Rowe</b>.</p>
