        celebrations held in Arborfield in 1925, listing in great detail those 
        who helped. At this time, there was no Village Hall, and so people met 
        in the school hall, which was normally divided into two school rooms.</p>

        <p class="stbody"><b>CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS PARTY</b></p>
        <p class="stbody">The great event of the holidays - the Christmas party 
        - took place at the schools on Monday, when more than 100 children 
        attending the Arborfield and Barkham schools were entertained to tea. 
        Afterwards, the little guests made merry over bonbons and toy balloons. 
        They were much amused by the slides shown by the Rev. J. A. Anderson. A 
        magnificent Christmas-tree was given by Mr. John Simonds, and decorated 
        by Mr. W. J. Verrall and others. The tree was crowned with a fairy doll, 
        the gift of Mrs. Bowyer. Then came the distribution of upwards of 150 
        presents to present and future scholars. In addition, each child on 
        leaving received buns and an orange.</p>
        <p class="stbody">Before the party broke up the headmaster proposed a 
        vote of thanks to all who had contributed in any way: To Mr. John 
        Simonds, the Misses Simonds, the Rev. J. A. Anderson and Mrs. Anderson, 
        Mrs. Prescott, the Rev. and Mrs. P. H. Ditchfield, Mr. and Mrs.

        buns; Miss Harris, decorations and bonbons; Miss Bentley, superintending 
        the tea. In reply the Rev. J. A. Anderson proposed to the children that 
        they should thank Mr. and Mrs. Verrall, who wished to include Mrs. Bune, 
        Mrs. H. Kent, Mrs. Middleton, Mr. S. Naish and Mr. W. C. Grant, members 
        of the joint committee of the Women's Institute and British Legion. </p>
        <p class="stbody">Among the visitors were Miss A. Van C. Simonds, Miss 
        Garland, Mrs. Hart, Mrs. Bowyer, Mr. and Mrs. Miles, Mr. and Mrs.

        May 29th, illustrated with two photographs of children in costume; and 
        the <b>Harvest Festival</b>, reported on October 2nd. In addition, a 
        three-day <b>Furniture Sale at Arborfield Hall</b> was advertised for 
        several weeks from April 24th. However, during the Hunting season, there
