        Of course, the large

        Residents of Arborfield and Newland 
      lacked <strong><a href="councils_water_supply_1933.htm">mains 
      water</a></strong> 
      until the mid-1930s. In 1933,&nbsp;a pumping station was opened in the 
      grounds of Arborfield Hall with a reservoir on the Bearwood Road. Even
             
           then, it took years before the public wells 
      had all been made redundant, and in 2011 at least one house in 
      the village centre still relied on a septic tank rather than connection to mains 
      sewage.</p>      

        <p class="stbody"><strong>Electricity</strong> had been 
      supplied to the <strong><a href="../WW1/WW1_Army_Remount_Service.htm">Remount 
      Depot</a> </strong> for many years,&nbsp;but 
      the villagers who worked there had to rely on candles and oil lamps in 
      their own 
houses.</p>      

        <p class="stbody">In the early 1930s the <strong 
      >National Grid</strong> erected pylons across 
      Arborfield and Barkham, prompting discussion by <strong>Wokingham Rural 
      District Council</strong> about rural 
      electricity supply, as reported by the <strong>'Reading 
      Mercury'</strong> on 15th December 
1934:</p>      

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><em><strong><font 
      size=4>Arborfield's Move to Obtain Electricity.</font> </strong></em>
</p>      

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><em>The clerk of the 
      <strong>Arborfield Parish Council</strong> forwarded a reply received from 
      the<strong> Thames Valley Electric Supply Co.</strong> regarding the 
      possibility of an electricity supply in Arborfield. The company explained 
      that the Council's query to the <strong>Central Electricity Board</strong> 
      had been sent on to them, and they pointed out that the <strong>grid lines 
      were for the purpose of carrying electricity in bulk over large 
      distances</strong>, and <strong>not for retail supply</strong>. </em>
</p>      

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><em>The company had under 
      consideration schemes for supplying Arborfield at a future date, but at 
      this early stage they were unable to say when those schemes would be 
      carried out. In the covering letter the parish council said the distant 
      date mentioned by the company might be a very distant one, and they asked 
      the District Council to use their greater influence in the matter. 
      </em>
</p>      

        <p class="stbody" align="center"><em>The chairman said a 
      similar position had arisen in <strong>Hurst</strong>, where one half of 
      the village was supplied. Representations to the company had so far not 
      produced any results. There should be cables along all roads where a 
      reasonable number of houses had been erected. The clerk was instructed to 
      write to the company on the matter.</em> <br>
</p>      

        <p class="stbody">
&nbsp;</p>      

        <p class="stbody">The parish council was right; the 
      'distant date'&nbsp;turned out to be&nbsp;much later than it had hoped. 
      Again, it was the Army that had electricity for its&nbsp;residents 
      who&nbsp;started moving into new houses&nbsp;at&nbsp;the <strong><a

        , but some of the 
      civilian workers living in the council houses alongside it had to wait until the 
      mid-1950s to catch up.&nbsp;</p>      

        <p class="stbody">1939 was the year that the local train 
      service from <strong>Wokingham</strong> and <strong>'Winnersh 
      Halt'</strong>        
            was&nbsp;electrified. The 
      <strong>Southern Railway</strong> had for several years taken advantage of 
      low-cost loans for&nbsp;capital projects that relieved unemployment, and 
      their electric service had spread gradually through Surrey and Berkshire 
      until it finally reach Reading. The <strong>Great Western</strong> was 
      also exploring the electrification of <strong><a href="#Railways">suburban 
      lines from Paddington to Reading</a></strong> (which it was reported 
      in&nbsp;1937 could&nbsp;be provided&nbsp;for only £90,000).</p>      

        <p class="stbody"><strong><a 
      href="memories_newspapers_WWII.htm">World War II 
      changed&nbsp;everything</a></strong>   , and made 
      such schemes a much lower priority for many years hence.&nbsp;On the 
      domestic front, we do have a good idea of how&nbsp;far <strong>mains 
      electricity</strong> had spread, thanks to the <strong><a 
      href="../A_N_1947.htm">1947 Auction Sale document for the Newlands 
      Estate</a></strong>, and also the&nbsp;<strong><a 
      href="../anpcouncil.htm">Annual Parish&nbsp;Meeting 
      Minutes</a></strong>. Residents living at Nos. 15 - 24 Council Houses (near the 
      Bramshill Hunt) asked at the 1952 Annual Parish Meeting (APM) when they 
      would be connected to Mains electricity, and repeated their plea in 1954. 
      They finally achieved their aim a year later By the 1956 APM, the Parish 
      Council Houses in Greensward Lane had received mains electricity - but 
      their days were numbered. They were condemned within 6 years.</p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>Mr. Waghorn 
      said railway electrification had played such an important part in the 
      development of many towns in Southern England that it should be welcome 
      news to tradespeople and residents in the Reading district that by July 
      this year the Sunningdale-Reading section would be converted from steam to 
      electric traction, giving a through electric service to and from Waterloo. 
      Certain Great Western electrification schemes now under consideration 
      might in the near future result in the electrification of the 
      Paddington-Reading route at a cost of £90,000.</i>

      London to Reading, via Slough, scheme, Mr. Waghorn said electrification

      as the one I mention, can you imagine the number of people who would 
      decide to make their homes at or near Reading? The number of season-ticket 
      holders who would travel to London daily from Reading would soon rival the 
      number of Brighton season-ticket holders. Land values would increase, 
      building activities would be redoubled, and careful control by the local 
      authority would ensure that only suitable development took place. The 
      prosperity of Reading tradespeople would take an upward trend with
