no deserving case in the parish of Arborfield escaping his attention. Mr. Sturges proposed that the deep sympathy of the Board be conveyed to Mrs. Rickman

<p class="MsoNormal">Stuart's naval records show that 
      he started his training as a Cadet on HMS Victory on 26th June 1857, and 
      at the end of 1864 he&nbsp;was a Lieutenant on HMS Cadmus, serving in 
      North America and the West Indies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From November 1869 he served in 
      the Pacific as a Lieutenant on HMS Zealous when it was commanded by 
      Francis Alexander Hume and was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Arthur 
      Farquhar (who had reached the rank of Vice-Admiral by the time of Stuart's 
      funeral).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On New Year's day 1879, Stuart 
      took command of HMS Frolic in China for over a year and a half, returning 
      to Chatham.&nbsp;From 1883 to 1886, he&nbsp;commanded the old wooden 
      sailing ship HMS President, used as a Drill ship for the Royal Naval 
      Reserve in the West India Docks. He finally retired&nbsp;on 10th January 
      1891.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the 1891 Census, Stuart and 
      Caroline were living in comfort at Arborfield Grange, with seven servants: 
      a Butler, Footman, Groom, Cook, Lady's Maid, Housemaid and Kitchenmaid. 
      Their Coachman lived in Greensward Lane at 1, Grange Cottages, while the
