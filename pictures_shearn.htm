<p class="stbody"><b>Martin Shearn</b> was Parish Clerk from  1964 to 1982, and 
has built up a good collection of old postcards, plus a set of photographs of 
the village from his time as Clerk. </p> 
       
      
<p class="stbody" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">
In the 1960’s the Parish Council published a bi-monthly 
newsletter, but something more comprehensive was needed, with more information 
from village organisations. Mary Mitford claimed the name ‘Our Village’ for 
Three Mile Cross, so was the title ‘Your Village’ a reference to the previous 
century?<a href="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1970.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The first 'Your Village', published in 1970" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1970_TN.jpg" width="148" height="187"></a></p>
       
      
<p class="stbody" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">
The first <b>‘Your Village’ </b>was distributed in 
1967; the cover was drawn by Andrew Hester, who was on the council. He also 
designed all of the following covers.&nbsp;The booklet was distributed to each house 
in the Arborfield &amp; Newland parish, which meant carefully selecting houses in 
the Garrison area where the parish boundary with Barkham is not obvious. </p>
<p class="stbody"><a href="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1973.jpg">
<img border="0" hspace="5" alt="The second 'Your Village', published in 1973" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1973_TN.jpg" width="135" height="187"></a>Later books were issued when a new 
council was elected, in 1970, 1973, and 1976. The last one in 1983 was out of 
line, and wasn’t completed until a year after Martin had resigned as Parish 
Clerk. </p>

<p class="stbody">The cover of the third book was 
entitled "See what's been cooked up for - Your Village". The drawing showed the 
25th anniversary of the union of Arborfield PC and Newland PC.&nbsp; "Play a part in 
- Your Village" in 1976 referred to the new Arborfield Park; while the final one 
"The Arbor's ba<a href="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1976.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="'Play a part in Your Village', published in 1976" vspace="5" align="right" src="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1976_TN.jpg" width="141" height="187"></a>ck in - Your Village"&nbsp; commemorated the acquisition of Pound 
Copse. <br>
<br>
The booklets all carried a small 
charge on the cover to stop people just asking for too many copies.&nbsp; Quite a few 
were sold as parishioners wanted to send them to friends.<a href="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1983.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="'The Arbor's back in Your Village', published in 1983" vspace="5" align="left" src="images/M_Shearn/Cover_1983_TN.jpg" width="142" height="187"></a>&nbsp; Assembly of the 
numerous pages was done by councillors walking around the Shearn’s kitchen with 
each page laid out along the worktop.&nbsp; Martin followed, armed with a long arm 
stapler borrowed from work.</p>

<p class="stbody">Some of 
the articles sowed the seeds of the Local History Society - an excellent example 
is the story from Guy Bentley about <b><a href="Memories_Street.htm">Arborfield 
Street in 1910</a></b>.&nbsp; Here is a list of the series:</p>

      
<p class="stbody">Several of Martin's pictures were featured in the History 
Exhibition in 1994 and made it to the Web-site some time ago, but those that 
didn't make it first time round (and which are not duplicated elsewhere on this 
site) are shown on this Web page.</p> 
       
      
<p class="stbody">Some of the old postcards came from <b>Mr. Ridler</b>, an 
amateur local 
historian, who passed them on to Martin. The collection includes a few published 
by 'Whitten' of Spencer's Wood, and others by Collier, some of which aren't in 
the <b><a href="pictures_collier.htm">Collier Collection</a></b> at the Museum 
of English Rural Life. Click on each one for a larger image.<a href="images/M_Shearn/Christmas_Postcard.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="5" alt="Christmas Greetings from Arborfield Hall" vspace  =5 align=right src="images/M_Shearn/Christmas_Postcard_TN.jpg" width=251 height=159 ></a></p> 
       
      
<p class="stbody"><b>Arborfield Hall</b> is well-represented, and includes a 
special Christmas card which Mrs. Hargreaves sent to the Rector's wife in the early 
1900's. She wrote: </p>
       
      
<p class="stbody"><b><i>"Dear Mrs Anderson, <br><br>This is Dymott’s 
handiwork with a camera my Flora gave him &amp; I wish you &amp; our dear Rector with 
its every blessing for Christmas &amp; I hope I shall see you both here later on,<br><br> 
Yours affectionately, S Hargreaves, 11 Dec."</i></b></p>
       
      
<p class="stbody">Two pictures of the Hall were from Whitten from about 1910; on 
the back of the right-hand picture, Mr. Ridley 
commented: <b><i>"On extreme right, Jacobean laundry &amp; 
stables demolished in 1927. Extreme left demolished by Mr Allsebrook. Third 
window from left was where children received gifts from Mrs Hargreaves at Annual 
School Treat."</i> </b>

<b>Church Lane</b> hasn't changed much over the years, apart from having an 
asphalt surface. This postcard is looking towards the junction with Mole Road /

Along Church Lane is the old <b>Reading Rooms</b>, now known as <b>Reading Room 
Cottage</b>. It was originally erected as a memorial by the Hargreaves family. 
This postcard is thought to be by Collier, though the back of the card doesn't 
record the photographer. It does have the hand-written name <b>'Hainworth'</b>, 
as do several photos of the ruins of the old church and the present church 
building seen below. </p>

During Martin's time as Parish Clerk, the <b><a href="memories_Park.htm">Park</a></b> on Swallowfield Road was 
opened. This photo from July 1973 shows the newly-completed field being equipped
