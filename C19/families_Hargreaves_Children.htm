<p><strong>Thomas and Sarah Hargreaves</strong> of Arborfield Hall married in 
1855 and had eight children roughly 2 years apart. However, by 1870, <strong>Thomas</strong> had 
taken a mistress and bought a separate property named The Mount in Bishopstoke, 
Hampshire, where another son, <strong>Cecil Montague</strong>, was born to his mistress,
<strong>Mrs. 
Warriner</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p><strong>Sarah</strong> was left to complete the education of their children, and to help 
	  ensure that they married well. It seems that she was very successful in 
	  this aim, as shown in the attached newspaper reports of their weddings. It 
	  appears that Thomas was '<em>persona non grata</em>' in Arborfield&nbsp;after 1870, and 
	  the reports seem to make the point that Thomas was absent from his 
	  children's weddings. </p>
	  <p>The first daughter to marry was given away by her uncle <strong>John 
	  Hargreaves, M.F.H., of Maiden Erleigh</strong>, while others were given 
	  away by their brother <strong>John Reginald Hargreaves</strong> once he 
	  had reached adulthood.</p>
	  <p>Thomas was 
	  present at his nephew <strong>Lieutenant John Hargreaves’ wedding</strong> in London while 
	  it appeared that Sarah was absent. On the other hand, Thomas was not at 
	  Lieutenant John’s sister <strong>Amy’s wedding</strong> at St. Peter’s Earley, though Sarah 
	  was present. </p>

	  <b> 
	  MARRIAGE OF MR. FREDERICK WOLLASTON AND MISS HARGREAVES</b></p>
	  <p>On Tuesday, the 18<sup>th</sup>, 
	  the picturesque village of Arborfield was enlivened by the festivities 
	  attending the wedding of Miss Annie Hargreaves, of Arborfield Hall, Berks, 
	  and Frederick Eustace Arbuthnott Wollaston (Queen's Bays), only son of 
	  Major Wollaston (late Enniskillen Dragoons), of Shenton Hall, 
	  Leicestershire.</p>
	  <p>The road from the Hall to 
	  the church was very prettily decorated with arches of evergreens (bearing 
	  the initials of the bride and bridegroom) erected by the villagers. The 
	  church, also, was very tastefully ornamented with choice flowers, and the 
	  bright gleams of the sun set off the handsome costumes to the greatest 
	  advantage.</p>
	  <p>Carriages began to arrive at 
	  the church about eleven, and continued to do so in rapid succession until 
	  the arrival of the bridegroom, accompanied by his best man, Mr. Ernald 
	  Morley [sic]. The bride arrived shortly after, with her mother, and was 
	  received by her eight bridesmaids. </p>
	  <p>The ceremony was performed 
	  by the Rev. Sir John Hayes, Bart., (rector of the parish), assisted by the 
	  Rev. E. Taylor. The bride was given away by her uncle, Mr. John 
	  Hargreaves, of Maiden Erlegh (M.F.H.). Her dress was composed of white 
	  satin Duchesse, trimmed with Brussels lace and orange blossoms; the veil 
	  (the gift of her mother) was of magnificent Brussels point; under this she 
	  wore a diamond tiara, presented by the bridegroom, also a splendid diamond 
	  cross, the gift of her uncle, Mr. John Hargreaves, and a diamond star, 
	  given by her grandmother (Mrs. Washington Jackson). </p>
	  <p>The bridesmaids were Miss 
	  Hargreaves, Miss Edith, and Miss Clara Hargreaves (sisters of the bride), 
	  Miss Wollaston and Miss Alexina Wollaston (sisters of the bridegroom), 
	  Miss Emma and Miss Amy Hargreaves (cousins of the bride), and Miss Hunter; 
	  they were attired in pale blue cashmere and silk Princesse dresses, 
	  trimmed with cream lace; the mod caps, trimmed with blue silk, were much 
	  admired, as were also the gold bracelets presented to each by the 
	  bridegroom.</p>
	  <p>We must not omit to mention 
	  that the “Wedding March” was most ably rendered by two ladies (friends of 
	  the bride), as the parties left the church. Mr. Hargreaves afterwards 
	  received about seventy relatives and friends at breakfast.</p>
	  <p>The bride's travelling dress 
	  was dark blue velvet, light cloth coat richly embroidered and trimmed with 
	  fur, and hat of blue velvet. At half-past two Mr. and Mrs. Frederick 
	  Wollaston left Arborfield Hall for Dover, <i>en route</i> for the 
	  continent, amid a shower of rice and slippers.</p>
	  <p>The festivities were brought 
	  to close by a dance, to which the <i>elite</i> of the neighbourhood were 
	  invited, and it was kept up with much spirit until a late hour. The bridal 
	  presents were very numerous and costly, amongst which were: - […] Captain 
	  Hargreaves, gold parure composed of necklet, pendant, bracelet, and 
	  ear-rings, set with emeralds and diamonds; […]</p>
	  <p>[<i>NOTE: according to the 
	  Hampshire Advertiser, 26th December 1877: <b>'The Schooner Yacht Ianira,

	  <b>MARRIAGE OF VISCOUNT EXMOUTH AND MISS EDITH HARGREAVES</b></p>
	  <p>On Tuesday, the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
	  inst., the picturesque village of Arborfield was astir at an early hour on 
	  the occasion of the marriage of Viscount Exmouth and Miss Edith 
	  Hargreaves, of Arborfield Hall. The wedding party assembled at the Parish 
	  church, which was tastefully decorated with beautiful flowers. </p>
	  <p>The bridegroom, attended by 
	  his best man, the Hon. William Pellew, arrived shortly after eleven, and 
	  the bride came a little later. She was led to the altar by her brother, 
	  and wore a handsome dress of duchesse satin, with flounces and veils of 
	  Brussels lace, the latter fastened with a brooch of diamonds, the gift of 
	  her mother. She wore as ornaments three diamond stars, the gift of the 
	  bridegroom, and also a handsome dragon-fly brooch, the gift of her uncle, 
	  Mr. John Hargreaves, M.F.H.</p>
	  <p>The bridesmaids were the two 
	  sisters (Flora and Lilian) of the bride, Maud and Violet Bradshaw 
	  (step-sisters of the bridegroom), and Miss Mary Hargreaves (cousin of the 
	  bride), and Miss Walter. They were charmingly attired in costumes of 
	  cream-spotted muslin, trimmed with lace and pale blue ribbons, lace caps 
	  with pale blue aigrettes, carrying baskets of roses and maidenhair fern, 
	  and parasols to match. </p>
	  <p>The service, which was 
	  partly choral, was performed by the Rev. Sir John Hayes, Bart., and the 
	  address was given by the Rev. Canon Fleming, of St. Michael's, 
	  Chester-square. After the ceremony the guests, about eighty in number, 
	  assembled at Arborfield Hall to a most <i>recherché</i> breakfast, and at 
	  three o'clock the happy pair left for the north, <i>en route</i> for 
	  America.</p>
	  <p>The wedding presents were as 
	  follows:- [...] ruby and diamond and sapphire and diamond porte-bonheur

	  <b>MARRIAGE OF MISS F. HARGREAVES AND CAPTAIN HIPPESLEY.</b></p>
	  <p>In delightful autumnal 
	  weather the wedding of Miss Florence Hargreaves, fourth daughter of Capt. 
	  Thomas Hargreaves, Arborfield Hall, and Captain William Henry Hippesley 
	  (Scots Greys), of Sparsholt House, Wantage, was solemnized on Thursday, at 
	  the pretty little church of Arborfield. The day was observed as a <i>fête</i> 
	  in the village, where Mrs. Hargreaves and her family are deservedly 
	  popular; and the church was crowded with invited guests. Three or four 
	  arches of evergreens were erected in the grounds of the hall, and bore 
	  suitable inscriptions; and the approach to the church was covered by an 
	  awning, and carpeted with red cloth. The chancel and altar rails were very 
	  elegantly decorated with ferns and white flowers.</p>
	  <p>Shortly after 2 p.m. The 
	  bridegroom, accompanied by his “best man” (Capt. Crabbie, of the Scots 
	  Greys), drove to the church from Newlands, the residence of Mr. John 
	  Simonds, where they had stayed the night. The non-commissioned officers 
	  and men of Captain Hippisley's troop, accompanied by men from other troops 
	  in the regiment, who had served with him in the “heavy camelry” in the 
	  Soudan campaign, lined the approach and also the aisle of the church, 
	  amongst the troopers present being Sergt.-Major Patterson and Corpl. Hardy 
	  (each wearing the “distinguished service” medal), and Corpl. Killhorn, who 
	  sustained 13 spear wounds at Abu Klea.</p>
	  <p>At 2.30 the bride, who was 
	  attended by Mrs. Hargreaves (her mother) and Mr. J. R. Hargreaves, her 
	  brother (who gave her away), entered the church, and the nuptials were 
	  proceeded with, the wedding party being welcomed by voluntaries played on 
	  the organ by Mrs. Simonds, of Newlands. The officiating clergy were the 
	  Rector of the parish (the Rev. J. Jones), the Rev. Sir John Hayes (who 
	  held the living of Arborfield for 40 years, and is now in his 87<sup>th</sup> 
	  year), and the Rev. J. T. Brown (Rector of Wokingham and Rural Dean). The 
	  hymns sung were “The Voice that breathed o'er Eden” and “Thine for ever, 
	  God of Love”, which were all sung well by the village choir. The 
	  bridesmaids were Miss Lily Hargreaves, Miss Hippisley, Miss Ella 
	  Hargreaves, Miss Hawes, Miss Storer, Miss F. Walter, and Miss Murdoch; and 
	  the bride's train was borne by Master Wollaston and Master Simonds 
	  (pages).</p>
	  <p>The bride wore a charming 
	  Duchesse dress, composed of white satin, with Brussels lace flounces, and 
	  sprays of orange blossoms. In her hair she had a diamond tiara and a large 
	  diamond brooch, the gift of the bridegroom; and she wore a diamond 
	  bracelet and brooch (presented by Captain Hargreaves), a diamond feather 
	  spray from Mr. and Mrs. Washington Jackson, and a large diamond crescent 
	  from Mr. John Hargreaves, M.F.H. The bride carried a splendid bouquet of 
	  orange blossoms, stephanotis, &amp;c. The bridesmaids were attired in elegant 
	  dresses of cream nun's veiling, trimmed with mauve satin, and cream 
	  coloured hats with feathers to match; and the pages were dressed in dark 
	  mauve velvet, trimmed with light mauve satin. They all carried bouquets of 
	  pale yellow roses. Each bridesmaid had a gold and pearl brooch, and the 
	  pages gold and pearl pins, the gift of the bridegroom. </p>
	  <p>At the close of the service, 
	  which was very impressively read by the officiating clergy, the wedding 
	  party returned to Arborfield Hall, and were entertained by Mrs. Hargreaves 
	  with the utmost hospitality. The band of the Scots Greys (30 in number), 
	  who had volunteered their services, performed a nice selection of music 
	  during the afternoon, under the baton of Mr. Barker, bandmaster. The bells 
	  of the parish church were rung at intervals. Mrs. Hargreaves liberally 
	  entertained the troopers and the bandsmen in a marquee erected in the 
	  park, and the villagers and other visitors were also catered for. The 
	  children attending the parish schools – who had their annual treat on the 
	  occasion – were also entertained in the park. After the wedding ceremony 
	  the bride was presented, by the non-commissioned officers and men of 
	  Captain Hippisley's troop, with a choice casket. The relatives and guests, 
	  who were very numerous, assembled at luncheon in the house; and just 
	  before five o'clock the newly-wedded paid left, amid showers of rice and 
	  slippers, for London, <i>en route</i> for the Isle of Wight.</p>
	  <p>The wedding presents were 
	  very numerous, […] Diamond bracelet and diamond brooch, Captain 
	  Hargreaves. [...] Biscuit box, non-commissioned officers and men of F 
	  Troop, Scots Greys.</p>

	  <b>[John Reginald Hargreaves – Bertha Gamage de Lacy 
	  Nicholl-Carne]</b></p>
	  <p>Yesterday afternoon, with 
	  choral service, at the fashionable church of St. Peter’s, Eaton Square, 
	  S.W., in the presence of a very large and aristocratic assembly, many of 
	  whom had come to town specially for the occasion, the wedding took place 
	  of Mr. John Reginald Hargreaves, late R.N., of Arborfield Hall, Berks, son 
	  of Captain Thomas Hargreaves, J.P., Berks, (Sheriff 1867), R.N.R., of The 
	  Mount, Bishopstoke, Hants, and grandson of the late Mr. Washington 
	  Jackson, of Belgrave Square, London, and Miss Bertha Gamage de Lacy 
	  Nicholl-Carne, of Nash Manor, Glamorgamshire, daughter of the late Mr. 
	  John Whitlock Stradling-Carne, M.A., D.C.L., J.P., Glamorganshire 
	  (Sheriff, 1874), of St. Donat’s Castle and Dunlands, Cowbridge, and Nash 
	  Manor, Bridgend, South Wales.</p>
	  <p>The church was profusely 
	  decorated with tall palms and blooming plants, the font being specially 
	  ornamented with cut flowers, reflecting great credit on the lady officials 
	  of that church, to whom the floral decorations were entrusted. The nuptial 
	  ceremony was very impressively rendered by the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop 
	  of Llandaff, assisted by the Rev. A. Thornton and the Rev. T. Jones, 
	  clergy of St. Peter’s.</p>
	  <p>The bride was accompanied by 
	  her brother, Mr. J. D. L. Nicholl-Carne, who conducted her in procession, 
	  headed by the officiating clergy and surpliced choir, during the singing 
	  of a nuptial hymn, to the chancel rails, and, in due course, gave her 
	  away. The bridegroom, who had arrived some time previously, was attended 
	  by his personal friend, Lieutenant the Hon. George Arthur Hardinge, R.N., 
	  of H.M.S. Britannia, son of Viscount Hardinge, who acted as best man.</p>
	  <p>The bride wore a magnificent 
	  court train of white satin brocade over a petticoat of “faile splendide”, 
	  covered with exquisite Honiton point lace, the gift of the bridegroom’s

	  fastened with three diamond stars and diamond aigrette, the gift of the 
	  bridegroom’s father (Captain Hargreaves), and a superb diamond brooch, the 
	  gift of Mrs. Patterson. She carried a “Goodyear” bouquet, a fine specimen 
	  of floral art, bound with streamers <i>en suite</i>, completing an 
	  exceptionally pretty and much-admired bridal attire. </p>
	  <p>A bevy of six youthful 
	  bridesmaids awaited the bride at the entrance to the church. These young 
	  ladies were Miss Hargreaves, Miss Ella Hargreaves (sisters), the Hon. 
	  Georgina Pellew, niece of the bridegroom, Miss Dawson Scott, niece of the 
	  bride, Miss Jeffray, and Miss Alice Brown, and were charmingly gowned in 
	  white Bengaline skirts, with Louis XV. coats of white brocade, with small 
	  blue flowers of unique design. They also wore three-cornered hats, with 
	  pale blue feathers <i>en suite</i>. The bridegroom’s presents to them were 
	  brooches, with naval badge with gold crown and silver anchor on blue 
	  enamel, with the initials “J” and “B” in diamonds, with twisted cables in 
	  gold. They also carried “Goodyear” bouquets of Marechale Neill roses, tied 
	  with pale blue streamers <i>en suite</i>. The bride was also followed by 
	  her two nephews, Master Gilbert Nicholl-Carne and Master Nigel 
	  Nicholl-Carne, picturesquely-costumed, who performed their duties with 
	  grace.</p>
	  <p>After the nuptial ceremony 
	  the bridal party adjourned to Eaton House, Eaton Square, S.W., the town 
	  residence of Mr. and Mrs. Crawshay, of Cyfarthfa, where the reception was 
	  held, which was largely attended. Early in the afternoon Mr. and Mrs. J. 
	  Reginald Hargreaves bade adieu to their many friends, and left for their 
	  honeymoon tour, the costume de voyage being fawn crêpon, trimmed with gold 
	  embroidery over salmon silk, and gold hat, with salmon feather <i>en suite</i>. 
	  The presents, which numbered over 300, were exceptionally handsome, 
	  costly, and appropriate.
