  <p><b>David Cliffe</b>, Reading Local Studies Librarian, has kindly put 
  together some biographical details about H. A. Giles: <br>
  <br>
  <b>Mary Southerton</b>, in her book <b>&quot;A Century of Photography in Reading&quot;</b>, 
  records <b>Harold Augustine Giles</b> as working from 2 Baker Street, Reading, 
  between 1912-1914, and from 83 Audley Street, Reading, from 1915 to 1955. </p>

      
  <p>[Audley Street is a street of terraced houses between Oxford Road and 
  Portman Road.]<br>
  <br>
  A gentleman who had lived in Audley Street next door to Mr. Giles rescued a 
  box of postcards when he died, and over 2,000 were donated to the Local 
  Studies Library, along with two pieces of correspondence. One is on headed 
  notepaper: <b>&quot;83 Audley Street, Reading. H. A. Giles, commercial photographer 
  and photographic view publisher&quot;</b>, and is dated 16 March 1922. Mr. Giles 
  was in correspondence with the sub-postmaster at Kintbury, with a view to 
  selling him some postcards. The other is a postcard from the sub-postmistress 
  at Medmenham, dated 14 May 1940, about buying postcards from him.<br>
  <br>
  It seems likely that a lot of Mr. Giles's postcard business was done in this 
  way. Many of his pictures aren't the traditional &quot;postcard&quot; views, but are of 
  everyday buildings - shops, cottages and country lanes in rural areas. In 
  Reading many of the pictures are streets of ordinary houses which other people 
  didn't photograph. The sales were presumably mainly to local people through 
  shops in the neighbourhood. Reading and its suburbs, and many villages around, 
  were covered, including villages in South Oxfordshire and North Hampshire. <br>
  <br>
  The donor told David Cliffe that in the end, Mr. Giles had lived on his own, 
  and that there was no-one who might have a family or commercial interest in 
  the cards. He said that Mr. Giles had never owned a motor vehicle, but 
  strapped his camera tripod to his bicycle. He also said that there was no 
  electricity supply to the house, and that Mr. Giles had developed his 
  photographs by gas-light!<br>
