        story of the dedication ceremony of the new memorial cross, as 
        transcribed below: </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Arborfield War Memorial - 
        Unveiling by Mrs. Stuart Rickman</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Despite the fact that there was 
        a continuous downpour of rain all the afternoon, almost the whole 
        population of Arborfield and Newlands [sic] gathered to witness the 
        unveiling of the village war memorial on Saturday afternoon. The 
        memorial is in the form of a rustic Celtic cross of Cornish granite and 
        the names of the ‘glorious dead’ are inscribed on the base. The ceremony 
        was performed by <b>Mrs. Stuart Rickman, formerly of Arborfield Grange</b>. 
        The service commenced with the singing of the hymn “O God, our help in 
        ages past”, and this was followed by a prayer of dedication, recited by 
        the Vicar, the <b>Rev. J. A. Anderson</b>.</span></p>

        John Simonds</b>, who represented the Memorial Committee, said they had 
        met to do honour to those brave men of Arborfield and Newlands who gave 
        up their lives in the late war. Everyone would remember that when the 
        question of a memorial was first brought up, there were differences of 
        opinion as to what form it should take. Some suggested that it should 
        take the form of a structure in the villages, while others thought that 
        something in the church or churchyard was preferable.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">He thought they could congratulate 
        themselves that the difficulty had been so well adjusted. The excellent 
        support given when the appeal for funds was made caused the committee to 
        consider that they were quite justified in carrying out the wishes of 
        all parties. So the cross had been erected, and it was proposed that a 
        <b><a href="#Dedication">tablet</a></b> should be placed in the church later.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Those 
        men whom the cross commemorated had participated in the most terrible 
        war history had ever known, and the village was proud of them. They came 
        forward at the call of the King and country, and fought for right and 
        for their country. They were all grieved that so many of them would 
        never return, and it was to their memory that the cross was erected. It 
        was not that they would ever forget them, for their memory was engraved 
        in every heart, but the memorial might act as an incentive to the people 
        of Arborfield for generations to come, and if need be, though he hoped 
        the occasion would never arise, to urge the men to come forward to fight 
        for the right, and to fight for their King and country.</font></span></p>

        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Mrs. 
        Rickman then said that when she was invited to come to Arborfield to 
        unveil the memorial, she realised that the inhabitants were conferring 
        on her the very greatest honour, and she was very touched by it. The 
        parishioners had shown her numerous honours during the time she resided 
        there, and she thanked them from the depth of her heart. They had been 
        her friends in both her happy days and her sorrows. It would, she 
        thought, have been better if some great commander could have unveiled 
        the cross, for he could have spoken of the men's splendid services and 
        their bravery, which it was quite impossible for her to do adequately.

        <p class="stbody" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">But she 
        could speak for the men as she knew them in their childhood, and also of 
        how unflinchingly they went forward at the call of duty. She could not 
        allow the occasion to pass without paying a tribute to the parents and 
        wives of those men, to those who were left behind, and who bore the 
        strain of waiting through those long years splendidly and with great 
        fortitude. The cross would stand for a three-fold meaning.</font></span></p>

        thanked Mrs. Rickman for unveiling the cross. During the time that Mrs. 
        Rickman had lived in the parish, she had gained the esteem and 
        admiration of all who came in contact with her. That day they had come 
        to carry out the last act of the war, to render homage to the dead for 
        having done their part. He now asked those present to do their part by 
        striving to preserve what those men had died for - liberty and the 
        welfare of their country. They could not forget the men, and those who 
        had suffered would find sympathy in their countrymen, and in the 
        knowledge that the sacrifices of their men were not in vain. The spirit 
        of their glorious dead was embodied in that memorial. When that spirit 
        ceased to be amongst them, then the end of their Empire would be near at 
        hand. </font></span></p>

        the example of those brave men would never fail, but that everyone would
