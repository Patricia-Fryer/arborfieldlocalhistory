        In 1839, the year of the Arborfield Tithe Map, New Farm (known later as 
        Bridge Farm and then as Farley Farms) with other land in Arborfield was 
        part of the Swallowfield Park Estate, which had been bought in the 
        1820’s by Sir Henry Russell, 1st Baronet. By 1839 the Estate was owned 
        by Sir Henry Russell, 2nd Baronet and as well as New Farm, included 
        Whites Farm, Bartletts Farm and Ducks Nest Farm as the Arborfield 
        portion of the Estate.</p>

        <p class="stbody">New Farm at this time was occupied by James Fuller 
        (described as a yeoman in the 1841 census).The extent of the farm can be 
        seen on the map. James Fuller also occupied much of the land later known 
        as Whites Farm although it is not named as such on the map of 1839. </p>

        <p class="stbody">In 1884 we know from Estate Records that the acreage 
        of New Farm was 233.117 acres and included a farm house, 7 cottages, 
        stables and outbuildings and that a John Brant was in occupation.&nbsp; 
        The view from the Reading Road has changed little over the years.&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="sthead"><font size="4">The Second War and After</font></p>

        <p class="stbody">During the Second World War, in the early 1940’s, <b>Mr 
        Sammy Pyle</b> acquired Bridge Farm which he worked alongside <b>Tanners Farm</b> 
        whose land backed on to it, and <b>Rowes Farm</b>, both being in Swallowfield 
        and already farmed by him.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Bridge Farm was next farmed by <b>Major Forbes</b> and his 
        sons until it was acquired in circa 1950 by <b>Bridge Farm Estates Ltd.</b> At 
        this time it had one of the most modern milking parlours and farm set 
        ups in the country. During the time that Bridge Farm was owned by Bridge 
        Farm Estates Ltd. the rabbi visited at different times in the year in 
        order to bless the crops. <b>Mr John Seggons</b> was the farm manager and he 
        like other farmers had often had trouble from rabbits eating his crops, 
        that is until 1954 when myxomatosis struck. The disease left many 
        rabbits dead and Mr. Seggons reported that his men were finding as many 
        as 100 bodies a day. He estimated that he would harvest 10% more cereals 
        in 1955 as a result.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Here's a picture of <b>John Seggons</b>:</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" alt="John Seggons" src ="images/john_seggons.jpg" width=504 height=334 ></p>

        <p class="stbody">In 1961 Bridge Farm was involved with a study into the 
        “complete harvesting process - from combining to storage” and John 
        Seggons continued to win prizes (over 300 and 25 challenge cups since 
        1952) for roots, standing corn and sacked corn.</p>

        <p class="stbody">On October 6th 1962, <b>Bridge Farm</b> and <b>Tanners Farm</b> (Swallowfield) 
        were officially taken over by a new owner,
        <b>Mr. Peter Samuel</b>, son of the late second <b>Viscount Bearsted</b>. Mr Samuel 
        paid over £200 per acre for the 500 acres which comprised Bridge and 
        Tanners Farms and John Seggons remained as manager, the two farms were 
        run as two separate units - dairying at Bridge and arable at Tanners. It 
        was planned that the British Friesian herd would be replaced by 
        Ayrshires.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The winter of 1962 - 63 was harsh and before the 
        Siberian conditions and the snow fell, Mr Seggons had managed to plough 
        most of his fields. The snow, which had arrived just around Christmas, 
        was still in evidence at the beginning of March and about 60 acres of 
        land were under water as a result of the snow.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In October 1965 the Wokingham Show was held at Bridge 
        Farm and although it proved to be a great success it was marred by rain 
        which really came down from lunch time on the Saturday.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In 1977 Whites Farm was unexpectedly put up for sale 
        by auction and much of Whites Farm land and buildings were incorporated 
        into what is now known as the <b>Farley Farms Estate</b>. (see <b>
        <a href="properties_whites.htm">Whites 
        Farm</a></b>). </p>
