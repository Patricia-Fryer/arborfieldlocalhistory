        In Reading Local Studies Library there is an old note-book from the <b>Rev. Peter Ditchfield, 
        Rector of Barkham</b> for over 40 years, and also a well-known local historian, 
        who died in 1930.  </p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        The notes seem to have 
        been used for a <b>Berkshire Archaeological Society field-trip</b>, at a date 
        unknown, but probably several years before 1922, since it seems that <b>Beatrice Simonds</b> 
        had access to them for her <b><a href="../Arborfield_WI.htm">History</a> written 
        on behalf of the Women's Institute</b> in 
        that year. The note-book also contains information about 
        Wokingham's history, including extensive quotations in Latin.</p>

      
  <p class="stbody">
        Here is the main text from the notes on Arborfield.

  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">I have put together a few notes which I 
  have collected from various sources upon the history of this old village 
  Church of Arborfield. A little explanation is certainly necessary to enable us 
  to build again in imagination the edifice which once stood here. </span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The destructive hand of Time has been 
  laid heavily on the old Church of Arborfield, and however much the artistic 
  eye may be gratified by the sight of </span></p>
  <p class="stbody" align="center"><i><span lang="EN-GB">“the Ivy green,<br>
  That creepeth o’er ruins old”, </span></i></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">the Archaeologist can but lament over the 
  destruction of many interesting features, which used to mark this ancient 
  building. As far as I can gather, very little has been written about its 
  history; Mrs. Simonds, the daughter of the late Rector of Arborfield, Sir John 
  Hayes, and Sir John Conroy, have very kindly furnished me with some 
  information with regard to its recent history, and I have been able hurriedly 
  to gather a few other details which may be interesting to our Society.</span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">I have never heard a satisfying 
  derivation of the name ‘Arborfield’, and venture to suggest the following. The 
  name appears in ancient manuscripts in the form ‘Eberfield’. The meaning of 
  the termination ‘field’ or ‘feld’ is easy enough; it signifies a clearing 
  where trees were felled, and the ground prepared for agriculture. The Great 
  Forest of Windsor extended all over this country, and these villages of 
  Shinfield, Arborfield &amp; Swallowfield which we are visiting today mark the 
  spots where the early Saxon settlers made their clearings. The first part of 
  the word is more difficult, but I take it to mean “boar” (Saxon ‘afer’, which 
  we find also in ‘Eversley’) so that the name means ‘the clearing where the 
  wild boars abounded’, and no doubt caused much trouble to our Saxon 
  forefathers when they were planting their corn by the banks of the Loddon long 
  before William and his hungry followers came to eat up their inheritance. 
  Arborfield is not mentioned in the Domesday Survey, although Barkham, 
  Swallowfield &amp; Hurst all appear in that famous chronicle.</span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The old Church, the ruins of which you 
  have come to visit, was built in the year 1256 in the reign of Henry III, 
  about the same year as the Church of Swallowfield, and was attached to the 
  ancient and far-reaching parish of Sonning. It was dedicated to St. 
  Bartholomew. It was a chalk and flint structure, the tower at the West end 
  being carried on 4 wooden posts, and containing 5 bells which have been 
  removed to the new Church. The Chancel was 9 ft. x 21, the nave 58 ft. long by 
  28 ft. Two windows on the South side with a door in the centre of the wall.</span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">The porch (which looks so venerable) is a 
  modern structure, and was erected together with a part of West End Wall in 
  1863, when the New Church was consecrated &amp; the old one demolished. Part was 
  built by Sir Edward Conroy, the father of Sir John Conroy. There are two 
  aisles, one containing tablets to the memory of some members of the Conroy 
  family, and the other is in possession of the Hargreaves family, containing 
  the Standen tombs, of which we shall speak again. The two chapels were divided 
  by a wall in 1863.</span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Evidently some addition was made to the 
  Church in 1631 (possibly the Standen Chapel built), as a beam with that date 
  recorded on it was found and placed over the entrance to the Conroy Chapel in 
  1863. The door also is very old with its heavy iron-winged hinges extending 
  the entire width of the door.</span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">If we could cut away some of this ivy we 
  should find, near where the old pulpit stood, a piscine made of sandstone, 
  unornamented ?Stoop (wrong place – a hole in bottom). A credence table was 
  fixed to the wall on the south of the Chancel, &amp;* the remains of 3 stone 
  seats, or ‘sedilia’, have been discovered. Sir John Conroy found some 
  encaustic tiles of red colour with pattern of circles &amp; a flower shaped 
  ornament in the centre. The old font was of wood &amp; is preserved at the Hall by 
  Mrs. Hargreaves together with a curious old leaden Chalice &amp; Paten, and old 
  Bible.</span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">There is (among the ivy) a square recess 
  below the window in the South, which is probably an ‘ammbly’ [?] to contain 
  the sacred vessels used in the Eucharistic service. The roof of the old Church 
  was considered unsafe in 1863, so it was pulled down, and the church became 
  the ruin which you now behold. </span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">But the most interesting feature of the 
  old church was the Mural Paintings. The walls were covered with plaster and 
  whitewash, and their existence was only discovered when the roof was taken 
  off. I am indebted to Sir John Conroy for all information concerning them, as 
  all traces of colour have almost entirely disappeared. He states that with the 
  exception of the West wall, which had been the wall of the tower, all the 
  masonry bore traces of having been painted in fresco. </span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">On the East wall there were 3 painted 
  figures (3 ½ ft. high). Each figure under a painted canopy. The one nearest 
  the window represented an ecclesiastic, &amp; was much injured by being exposed to 
  the weather. A mitre was distinguishable of a low triangular shape, and 
  yellowish stripes representing a pall were discernable. Under the middle 
  canopy there were 2 figures, a woman and a child about 14 years old dressed in 
  brown draping. The 3<sup>rd</sup> figure was an ecclesiastic. Above the 
  figures the wall had been painted with reddish brown paint to represent 
  stones, with a little ornament in the centre of each stone. There were similar 
  paintings on the North side of the window. </span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">On the North &amp; South walls there were 
  remains of painted drapery of the same colour, 2 ft. wide, commencing about 2 
  ½ ft. from the ground (not like modern dado) &amp; above this strip of colour some 
  geometrical pattern was painted. All the woodwork of the roof was also 
  painted. It is a sad pity that all this beautiful work should have perished 
  absolutely.</span></p>
  <p class="stbody"><span lang="EN-GB">Some brass tablets remain, but rain and 
  frost will soon render them indecipherable:</span></p>

  <p class="stbody">In the Churchyard there is the tomb of Richard Hayes, 42 years Rector of the Parish, 
  who died March 17th 1797 aged 76 years. He was no relation to the 
  Revd. Sir John Hayes, Bart., who was so long the respected Rector of this 
  Parish &amp; who died a few years ago, the father of the late Mrs. John Simonds of 
  Newlands, in his 91st year. There are monuments of the Toogood 
  family. You will notice on the North side an immense yew tree which is 
  probably 500 years old, &amp; is a commemorative tree planted when this old church 
  was consecrated. Some tombs of the ancestors of the Simonds family lie beneath 
  its shade.</p>
  <p class="stbody">In the Hargreaves Chapel there is a fine tomb of William Standen, Lord of the Manor 
  of Arborfield, who died in 1639. He married Maria the daughter of Samuel 
  Backhouse of Swallowfield, &amp; their child is also buried in this vault. [Cue to 
  point to the wall tablet? – both tomb and tablet are now in the new Church] 
  This tablet is to the memory of Edward Standen, the last heir of the Standen 
  family who died a Bachelor in the year 1730. He was hero the poet Gay’s 
  facetious poem “Molly Mogg”, the daughter of the landlord of the Rose Inn in 
  Wokingham, which Pope &amp; Arbuthnot Gay used to frequent. The Manor then passed 
  into the hands of the heir Richard Aldworth, the father of the earl of 
  Braybrooke, and then to the Reeves family, and Pelsant Reeve, who married Jane 
  Mason, died in 1761 (monument moved to new Church). Their son John Reeves died 
  in 1814, and the estate passed into the hand of a Mr. Dawson who married the 
  heiress Elmira Reeves, &amp; died in 1832. Mr. Dawson pulled down the old 
  Arborfield House, so often mentioned by Miss Mitford in her book, &amp; partly 
  built the present Arborfield Hall. He made extensive Paper Mills, which were 
  burnt down, but the powerful water wheels are still in working order. Sir 
  George Russell is the present Lord of the Manor, and the estate was purchased 
  by Mr. Hargreaves who enlarged the Hall.</p>
  <p class="stbody"> I may mention that before the Standens, the Bulloke or Bullock family held the Manor; 
  there is an interesting deed of bequest to Parish of Barkham, contained in an 
  old Register Book, 1594, from Thomas Bullock of Arborfield. Several Bullocks 
  held the office of Sheriff of the County in the 14th, 15th and 16th Centuries. One of them is called in the&nbsp;pedigree the 
  celebrated “Hugh with the Brazen Hand” who appears to have lived here in early 
  times, though what he was famous for, or why he earned such a strange epithet, 
  I have not been able to discover.</p>
  <p class="stbody">The monuments of the Conroy family are all modern (Irish family). Sir Edward Conroy was the 
  Keeper of the Privy Purse for the Duchess of Kent, the mother of our late 
  Queen. In the Grange there was the earliest portrait of Queen Victoria ever 
  painted, taken when she was 5 or 6 years old, a valuable and interesting 
  portrait. The old Register books of the Parish were destroyed by fire.</p>
  <p class="stbody">I hope I have not detained you too long among these ancient ruins, but time so spent is not 
  mis-spent.&nbsp;</p>
