        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The Garth Hunt Point-to-point Races, 
        held at Arborfield Remount Depot on Tuesday, were attended by large 
        numbers from the surrounding districts, and fine weather prevailing, an 
        excellent day's sport was experienced. Among the many interested 
        spectators was H.R.H. Prince Henry. [A long list of officials followed, 
        led by the Marquis of Downshire, and including several parishioners].
        </span></p>
        <p class="stbody" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">An excellent course was provided, 
        with fairly simple jumps and not too difficult going. The crowd began 
        assembling early in the day, and by one o'clock some thousands were 
        present. A collection was taken up amongst them for the Hunt and this 
        amounted to £6 - 15s. The band of the 1st. Batt. K.R.R.C. was in 
        attendance. </span></p>

        <p class="stbody" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Some excellent races were witnessed, 
        and there were several very close finishes. [Detailed list followed].</span></p>
        <p class="stbody" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">At the conclusion of the events Mrs.

        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Mr. E. M. Sturges, in proposing a 
        vote of thanks to Mrs. Palmer, said as hon. secretary of a Hunt that 
        bore perhaps the most honoured name in England, he was more than 
        thankful to know that they jad members like Mr. and Mrs. Howard Palmer, 
        both of whom took such an interest in all kinds of sport. There was 
        nothing like fox-hunting, which had no politics in it. He called for 
        three cheers for Mrs. Howard Palmer, a call which met with a hearty 
        response.</span></p>
        <p class="stbody" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Mr W. Howard Palmer returned thanks, 
        and remarked that the last Garth Point-to-point Races were held in a 
        snowstorm. He said that they would hardly wish to disperse without 
        passing a hearty vote of thanks to the committee of the Garth Hunt, who 
        had managed the races so well, and especially to the hon. secretary, Mr. 
        E.M. Sturges, and Mrs. Sturges (Applause).</span></p>

        provided with lunch and tea. The catering was capably carried out my Mr. 
        J.E. Allnatt, of Earley.</span></p>

        The 'Reading Mercury' of Spring 1926 was full of classified 
        advertisements for Point-to-Point races. For the Garth Hunt, an 
        invitation to competitors was carried on February 27th and repeated on 
        March 6th, followed by an invitation for spectators on March 13th and 
        repeated on March 20th. Here is the text for the adverts.  </p>

        <p class="stbody" style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ">
        In an age when 
        few people owned cars, many bus excursions were laid on, covering a wide 
        area; the regular bus service would have sufficed for spectators from Reading, Shinfield,  Eversley, Yateley and Camberley. (Note the way of abbreviating <i>
        Omnibus</i> to <i>'Bus</i>, which was the accepted way of writing the 
        word until at least the 1940's):</p>
