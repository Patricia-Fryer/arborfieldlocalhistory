        <p class="stbody"><i>The following news article appeared in the 'Reading 
        Mercury' of February 25th 1950. The accident raised the issue of road 
        safety for children, and as a result, Arborfield and Newland Parish 
        Council pressed ever harder for pavements to be provided alongside the 
        A327 and on School Road:</i></p>

        <p align="center"><b>Girl’s Fatal Injuries </b></p>
        </font><font size="2">
        <p>An inquest was held at Reading on Monday on 7-years-old <b>Esme Jean 
        Hiscock</b>, of <b>26, Arborfield Hall, Arborfield</b>, who received 
        fatal injuries when she was knocked down by a lorry near the Arborfield 
        crossroads on Tuesday last week.</p>
        <p>A State-Registered nurse, <b>Mrs. Elma Evans</b>, of Arborfield, said 
        she was on a horse at the Arborfield crossroads. In front of her was the 
        bus from Reading, and, as it moved off, a little girl ran across the 
        road from behind it, and the accident occurred. Similar evidence was 
        given by <b>Mrs. Bernice Clewes</b>, of Church Lane, Shinfield, who had 
        just got off the ‘bus.</p>
        <p>The vehicle involved was an Army lorry, and a passenger, <b>L/Cpl. 
        Frank Fuller</b>, of the Airborne Forces Depot, Parachute Regt., Maida 
        Barracks, Aldershot, said they were travelling about 25 m.p.h. A ‘bus 
        passed in the opposite direction, and, as they got a clear view of the 
        road again, they saw a small girl step off the pavement on the off-side 
        and start to run diagonally across the road. The driver sounded his horn 
        and applied his brakes almost immediately, but they were carried forward 
        into a skid and struck the child. </p>
        <p>"At first the girl did not run particularly fast, but then she made 
        an attempt to cross in front of us by running faster", witness added.</p>
        <p>Similar evidence was also given by the driver, <b>Pte. Edward Herbert 
        Smith</b>, who said that he had been driving all kinds of Army vehicles 
        for over 10 years without any accident. </p>
        <p>Death was due to multiple fractures of the skull, with haemorrhage 
        into the brain. A verdict of "Accidental death" was returned by the 
        jury, and recording the verdict, the deputy coroner (Mr. A. E. Sheppard) 
        said: "The decision she made was clearly and unfortunately the wrong 
        one".</p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>The 'Reading Mercury' of 11th March 1950 reported 
        on the Parish Council meeting held on Monday 7th March, which included 
        this item:</i></p>

        <font size="2">
        <p>There was some discussion on the recent fatal accident at Arborfield 
        Cross, and it was suggested that the ‘bus stopping place might be 
        altered or police protection given to the school children. It was 
        decided to signpost the road to Wokingham. The clerk was asked to press 
        again for provision of footpaths in the village itself.</p>

        <p><i>Later that month, the 'Reading Mercury' of Friday 25th covered the 
        Annual Parish Meeting, where the accident was discussed again: </i></p>
        </font><font size="4">
        <p align="center"><b>Parish Meeting</b></p>
        </font><font size="2">
        <p>The <b>Arborfield and District annual parish meeting</b> was held at 
        the Village Hall on Monday, with <b>Mr. A. Jarvis</b> in the chair.</p>
        <p>The clerk (<b>Mr. A.J. Bentley</b>) reported that, following the 
        recent fatal accident at Arborfield Cross, he had written to the police 
        complaining of the non-observation of the thirty-mile speed limit in the 
        main street but no reply had been received. He had also written to the 
        district surveyor regarding footpaths, and suggesting "School Danger" 
        notices at the ‘bus stop. The surveyor had replied that a footpath was 
        out of the question at the moment, owing to the drastic reduction in the 
        Ministry of Transport grant; also he could not agree that further 
        "Danger" notices would serve a useful purpose.</p>
        <p><b>Mr. M. A. Andrews</b> strongly contested this and it was also 
        pointed out that many children came from the military camp each day and 
        alighted at the cross-roads. The <b>Rev. C.T.D. Sparshott</b> said the 
        military authorities had promised to instruct their drivers to exercise 
        care in driving through the village at certain times. Finally, it was 
        resolved to ask the Thames Valley Traction Co. to divert a ‘bus morning 
        and evening to bring children from the camp to school and to petition 
        the Ministry of Transport, to move the ‘bus stop to a point beside the 
        post office.</p>
