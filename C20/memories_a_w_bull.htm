        <b><font size="4">THE BULL at ARBORFIELD CROSS</font></b><br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>- by <b><a href="../memories_agricola.htm">Anthony Walton</a></b></i><br>
        <br>
        This is the story of our village pub. You might complain that it is not 
        a very interesting story but in England, where there is a pub for every 
        seven hundred and fifty inhabitants, every drinking man has “his pub” 
        and when he extols its virtues and takes you reverently to see it you 
        often wonder why.</p>

        <p class="stbody">
        <a href="../images/Swan%20album%207.jpg">
        <img border="1" hspace="5" alt="The Bull and its outbuilding in snow, from the 'Swan' Photo Album" vspace="5" align="right" src="../images/Thumb/swan%20album%207.jpg" width="143" height="98"></a>The Bull stands in the centre of the village of 
        Arborfield, at the cross roads, on the Reading/Farnborough road where 
        the traffic rushes by. It hasn’t any particular significance, but then 
        neither has Arborfield. No battles were fought there, none of the really 
        great was born there, and big events have passed it by but people have 
        lived there, mostly happily and contentedly, since it was an Iron age 
        settlement.</p>

        <p class="stbody">People have been brewing beer from 6,000 B.C., and 
        more people have been drinking it. Caesar’s men found us brewing when 
        they landed and remarked that Britons used vines only for arbours and 
        preferred “to drink a high and mighty liquor different from that of any 
        other nation, made of barley and water which leaves space enough for the 
        performance of any great actions before the spirits are quite 
        vanquished.” Well, I expect they were brewing away at Arborfield too, 
        but not in the present building of the Bull, which is seventeenth 
        century, and it is unlikely that they would have had such a pleasant and 
        comfortable place in which to refresh their spirits.</p>

        <p class="stbody">It is an attractive cream-washed building with some of 
        its timber frame showing. With its red tiled roof it stands out 
        pleasantly against the bright green background. The sign, a large and 
        placid looking bull, hangs over the door to remind us of the days when 
        people couldn’t read and such a pictorial indication of an inn was 
        necessary. Near it is a larger blue sign announcing that it is a 
        “Courage” pub. Most pubs today are owned by one or another of what is 
        sometimes called “The Beerage”.</p>

        <p class="stbody">It was never a famous hostelry, with a court yard that 
        rang to the stamp of horses’ hoofs and the cries of ostlers and 
        post-boys, only a little pub where the people of the village went to 
        diminish their sorrows or tell of their joys. Possibly under the fresh 
        new paint there are splashes of beer to celebrate Waterloo, the relief 
        of Mafeking, the end of the Great War and the defeat of Hitler.</p>

        <p class="stbody">As far as we know Queen Elizabeth never slept there 
        but Queen Victoria did call in to change horses on her way to see the 
        Duke of Wellington at Strathfield Saye. There is no mention of her 
        having supped the ale, but that need not be taken as a reflection on The 
        Bull or its beer as, unlike Queen Elizabeth I, whose “own beer was so 
        strong as there was no man able to drink it” Queen Victoria was not 
        renowned for her fondness for drink.</p>

        <p class="stbody">King George III on the other hand is said to have 
        refreshed himself at Arborfield when chasing a stag through the parish 
        in 1780. It is also said that somewhere near there is a bridle path used 
        by Highwaymen on their way to Southampton, so perhaps they too drank at 
        The Bull.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The <b><a href="../memories_garth.htm">Garth Hunt</a></b> used to meet outside until a few years 
        ago, but now the traffic has become too heavy and the place of hearty 
        red-faced huntsmen has been taken by paler quieter motorists.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In the last century the arrival of the railways, and 
        Victorian snobbery, meant the decline of the public house, though I 
        expect even then the village inn held its own as a local meeting place. 
        In this century the return of road traffic has given country inns a new 
        lease of life and an entirely different aspect. No longer the place 
        where villagers get “drunk for a penny and dead drunk for twopence” they 
        offer good food and company in pleasant surroundings.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The Bull offers a real fire in winter, no plastic 
        electric logs. There are no fancy fittings, it is not done up like “Ye 
        Olde English Tavern” with plastic lanthorns and barmaids in print 
        aprons, and there is no canned music. The proprietor’s wife however 
        makes very good pates and pies and business men call in from distant 
        places at lunchtime to eat them.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Part of the large garden has been turned into a car park - publicans no 
        longer have time to grow vegetables - but there is still some grass for 
        tables and chairs for children to take their coca-cola and crisps and 
        where those that prefer fresh air and a view of the little lambs in the 
        field opposite can drink their beer. Sometimes on a summer evening the 
        local troupe of Morris dancers trip and jingle in the car park in aid of 
        charity, they are folk dance enthusiasts from Reading University.</p>

        <p class="stbody">At the time of the Christmas draw the beer runs fast 
        and free sausages and hot potatoes are served to one and all. The fire 
        burns brightly and the atmosphere gets thick with smoke and joviality, 
        so that it doesn’t really matter if once again you haven’t won a bottle 
        of scotch or a Christmas hamper.</p>

        <p class="stbody">At all times it is a pleasant place to visit after a 
        morning’s gardening - to lean on the bar and view through the little old 
        windows the village green with the war memorial where the old market 
        cross used to stand, Victorian labourers’ cottages on their way up the 
        social scale, and Georgian Gentlemen’s houses going down a bit now that 
        their land has been sold, half-timbered cottages that have stood for 400 
        years and little modern “town” houses - a microcosm of the changing 
        scene in South East England today. Then if you get tired of the view 
        there is bar-billiards, darts or just talking.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The public house has through the years reflected the changing scene. The 
        Church, whose monks brought the first wine to England, gave us our first 
        inns, for pilgrims to rest in and replenish themselves. Then in the 17th 
        Century the thin ale of the middle ages gave place to strong beer, and 
        England’s Inns became renowned as unique in the world. The inhabitants 
        appreciated them too. England was reported to be full of “maultworms”, 
        the term at the time for the modern “bar-fly”.</p>

        <p class="stbody">A successful inn is one that grows into the times, 
        patched and altered and added to over the centuries. It is a commercial 
        undertaking so it always reflects the tastes of the day, and if it is to 
        survive it must be the way people want it.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The Bull has changed with the years - but not too 
        much. There is no juke-box or one armed bandits, only a fire, good food, 
        conversation, darts and bar billiards, just the way the people want it. 
        In many ways it reflects the changes in our lives. The old “public” 
        “saloon” and “lounge” is now one big bar where all meet and talk on 
        equal terms, and there are no squires or country bumpkins.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The front door, on a busy road, is bricked up and the 
        entrance is at the back through the car park. This would have been 
        frowned on in the last century as it was thought to encourage women and 
        children and the criminal riff-raff to have a door at the back of a pub, 
        so in many ways the changes it reflects are for the good.</p>

        <p class="stbody">About tomorrow we can only guess. Perhaps there will 
        be no village communities and all will be one vast urban area. Or maybe 
        the high-rise flats and modern houses will fall and the old timber-frame 
        buildings will remain. Could traffic leave the roads and take to the air 
        so that, apart from an overhead buzz, the British countryside would be 
        peaceful again and The Bull could once more open its front door?</p>

        <p class="stbody">Personally I rather hope that everything will stay 
        just as it is, but that I fear is hardly possible and perhaps not even 
        desirable.<br>
