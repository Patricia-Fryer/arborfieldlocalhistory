        <b><font size="3">From an article in "The Hop Leaf Gazette", September 
        1935 </font></b></p>

        <p class="stbody" align="center">
        <b><font size="3">(Simonds Brewery magazine)</font></b></p>

        <p class="stbody">It is not generally known that <b>The Swan, Arborfield</b>, 
        was built as far back as 1661, but the popular proprietor, <b>Mr. E. R. Penniston</b>, is as up-to-date as the premises are old. He is very keen on 
        his garden and has spent many pounds in beautifying it. By dint of hard 
        work he has had a wonderful display of flowers, fruit and vegetables, 
        and it would be hard to imagine pleasanter surroundings amid which to 
        partake of a cup of tea or quaff from a tankard of Simonds’ 
        world-renowned ale.  </p>

        <p class="stbody">Something to eat and something good at that, at any 
        time, is Mr. Penniston’s motto, and the ever-increasing number of 
        visitors who call there bear ample testimony to the excellence of the 
        food provided and the appetising manner in which it is served.</p>
        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" alt="The Swan, advertising 'Teas', probably 1930's" src ="images/Swan1.jpg" width=560 height=388 ></p>
        <p class="stbody">The other Sunday he supplied no fewer than 11 lunches 
        and 63 teas, and so pleased were his customers with their fare that they 
        called again later in the day and partook of further refreshment, many 
        of them having learnt to "Say, S.B.!"</p>
        <p class="stbody">A year ago there was the nest of a thrush in the 
        rosary at The Swan and the family was safely reared. This year a 
        chaffinch built her nest there, but a wicked old owl discovered it when 
        the nest contained young and made a meal of them.</p>
        <p class="stbody">
        <img border="0" alt="The Swan Tea Gardens, now replaced by the car park" src  ="images/Swangarden1.jpg" width=560 height=356 ></p>
        <p class="stbody">When I visited The Swan the other day the pictures of 
        some very fine fish in one of the rooms naturally arrested my attention. 
        I gathered that the genial landlord was an angler and I had not been in 
        conversation with him many minutes before I learned that not only was he 
        an angler, but a most expert one who had carried off numerous prizes by 
        virtue of his wonderful skill. He is President of no less than five 
        fishing clubs and on the committee of many others. Eight years in 
        succession has he won the West Hampstead Club Cup for Pike. The biggest 
        he took out of the Thames weighed no less than 17 lbs. 9 oz. He has 
        caught them much larger in reservoirs.</p>
        <p class="stbody">A member of the Deep Sea Angling Society, he won the 
        medal for bass caught off Beachy Head. These are but a couple of 
        instances of Mr. Penniston’s prowess in the gentle art.</p>
        <p class="stbody">He is equally successful in catching customers. And 
        the ground bait he uses is civility, prompt and proficient service, and 
        only the best of food and drink.</p>
        <p class="stbody">Call in and see him sometimes.</p>
