        <p class="stbody">Whether the 'Manor of Arborfield' is a property or a 
        title is a moot point, but  this article on the 'Lords of the Manor' is included here. 
        Two sketches of the old Manor House survive from a contribution to the
        <b><a href="C19/memories_BLHC.htm">Berkshire Local History Club</a></b> 
        in 1889 by <b>Emma Elizabeth Thoyts,<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> who 
        later became the 
        wife of </span><a href="C20/families_Cope.htm">John Hautenville Cope</a></b>; they are shown here. The first shows what 
        appears to be the front elevation:</p>

        <p class="stbody">The second shows what might have been the side 
        elevation, probably looking from the left when compared with this view. 
        The building was partly demolished when the original sketch was drawn:</p>

        <p class="stbody">The captions are: "Arborfield Manor House; Emma E. 
        Thoyts, Dec. 1889; Taken from a pencil drawing by J. Breedon, early 19th 
        Century".&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="sthead"><font size="4">THE LORDS OF THE MANOR OF ARBORFIELD</font><br>
&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="stbody">The Manor of Arborfield was not mentioned by name in 
        the Domesday Survey which was completed in 1086 and at this time formed 
        part of the Manor of Sonning, held by the Bishop of Salisbury.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The earliest mentioned “lord of the manor” seems to 
        have been a powerful Abbot called “Elsi” of the “Old Minster” (the 
        Cathedral Church) of Winchester. He held four manors and two estates, of 
        which Burghfield and Edburgefeld (Arborfield), dependent on Sonning, 
        were two. These he leased out, but there is no record to whom. Abbot 
        Elsi was at the “ Old Minster” in the reign of Edward the Confessor 
        (1042-1066) and was outlawed in 1070, after the Norman Conquest.</p>

        <p class="stbody">This indicates that the Manor of Arborfield is likely 
        to be Saxon. It consisted, as other manors did, of a castle or fortified 
        house standing in the “lords’ Demesne” (the Park lands); a church with 
        the churchyard round it, and nearby, a little house for use as a 
        Rectory. All these would generally be built close to a river (as in 
        Arborfield), so that there should always be a supply of fish on Fridays 
        and fast days. Along the river would be meadow lands. The peasants’ 
        cottages would be built close together and near crossroads, each with a 
        bit of ground surrounded by a fence. On the river, a mill belonging to 
        the lord would be built. Sometimes the manors were owned by a bishop, as 
        in the case of Arborfield, or an abbey where the dues had to be paid to 
        them.</p>

        <p class="stbody">The next “lord of the manor” mentioned after Abbot 
        Elsi was “Osmund Bullock of Edburghfeld”. He also paid tithes (a tithe 
        was a tax of one tenth of the annual produce of land or labour for the 
        support of the Church and clergy) to the great monastery at Abingdon for 
        some of his lands in Arborfield. The Bullock family were distinguished 
        and later held high positions in the county. In 1250 Gilbert Bullock, a 
        descendant of Osmund, made this declaration:</p>

        <p class="stbody"><i>“That all lands held by him in the Manor of 
        Sunninge was held subject to the Goodwill of the Bishop of Salisbury” he 
        bound himself and his heirs “to deliver it up to the Bishop or his 
        successors whenever called upon to do so.”</i></p>

        <p class="stbody">This Gilbert Bullock was made Kings’ Reeve in 1275 
        (i.e. a Trustee or Baliff of the Crown Lands).</p>

        <p class="stbody">By 1589, Thomas Bullock found it necessary to sell the 
        manors of Arborfield and Barkham to Edmund Standen, who was a Clerk of 
        the Petty Bag of the Court of Chancery. This sale was contested by the 
        Bullock family, <i>(see Arborfield and Barkham Manors in Contention 
        1589-1662 by David French)</i>.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Edmund Standen died in March 1603, the year the 
        Jacobean manor was built, to be succeeded by his son William. In 1615 
        Sir William was Sheriff of the County of Berkshire; he died in 1639.&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="sthead"><font size="4">THE MANOR AND ITS GENEALOGY</font></p>

        <p class="stbody">The manor of Arborfield is a manor within a manor, 
        lying within that of Sonning, and belonged formerly to the Bullocks, an 
        ancient family of this place:- several of whom served the office of 
        Sheriff in the 14th - 16th centuries:- one of them is called in their 
        pedigree “Hugh with Brazen Head”. </p>

        <p class="stbody">From this family, the manor passed into the possession 
        of the family of Standen, who created early in the 17th century a noble 
        mansion of Jacobean stature, on the former site of a more ancient house. 
        William Standen of Arborfield, Lord of the Manor of Arborfield, Barkham 
        etc., was Sheriff of Berkshire in 1615. He died 18th May 1639; one of 
        those large table monuments, so common in the 16th and 17th centuries 
        was erected in his memory in the chapel belonging to the family in the 
        parish church. This monument remains to this day, (in our present 
        church).<br>
        <br>
        The Standen family became extinct nearly 100 years subsequently, in the 
        time of Edward Standen, the last of his race, andthe person alluded to 
        in the well known ballad of “Molly Meg of the Rose” (Rose Inn in 
        Wokingham). He died in 1730 aged 27, and was buried in the vault of the 
        Standens in the freehold aisle attached to the parish church. Upon his 
        death, without issue, his estates devolved on his heir, Richard Aldworth 
        Esq., then a minor, and subsequently father to Lord Braybrooke; a 
        portion of these estates were sold during his minority by his guardians 
        under an act of parliament, but the advowson of the living - a rectory - 
        was reserved and still remains in the patronage of the present Lord 
        Braybrooke.<br>
        <br>
        The purchaser of the Arborfield Estate was Pelsant Reeves Esq. Master in 
        Chancery, who dying at the advanced age of 84 in 1764 was succeeded in 
        the property by his son John Reeves of Arborfield House, who dying at 
        the age of 80 at Andover in the year 1814, left issue, an only daughter, 
        Elvira, who marrying George Dawson of Yorkshire carried the Arborfield 
        Estate into that family. Mr. Dawson died in 1832 aged 69, was buried at 
        Arborfield and was succeeded by his son, George Pelsant Dawson.<br>
        <br>
        During the lifetime of the 2nd Mr. Reeves, the old mansion House built 
        by the Standens was let to tenants and allowed to fall into decay, and 
        George Pelsant Dawson was persuaded to dismantle it.</p>

        <p class="stbody">In the year 1837, Dawson pulled the old house entirely 
        down, preserving with considerable taste, the Boat House, commemorated 
        in the pages of Mary Mitford's “Our Village”, and nearly upon its site 
        erected a smaller residence of the same style and architecture.<br>
        <br>
        Arborfield Cottage (formerly a farmhouse) was much improved and 
        repaired by George Pelsant Dawson, who inhabited it for 6 years, 
        previous to his rebuilding the Hall. He let the cottage and grounds to 
        Edward Conroy on moving into Arborfield Hall. (Arborfield Cottage is now 
        called Arborfield Grange.)<br>
