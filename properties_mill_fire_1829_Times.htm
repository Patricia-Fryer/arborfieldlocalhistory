        <p class="stbody">There are three known newspaper articles on fires at 
        Arborfield Mill. This is from 'The Times' on 27th June 1829, and seems 
        to suggest that there was both a Paper Mill and a Corn Mill in adjoining 
        buildings. The Pither family have long links with farming in and around 
        Arborfield, while the Jeacockes were bailiffs to the Newlands Estate, 
        and were listed as Census enumerators over many years.</p>

        <p class="stbody">Thursday night (25th) at a quarter after ten o’clock, 
        a fire broke out in the drying room at Arborfield Paper-mill, five miles 
        from Reading, occupied by <b>Mr. Rogers</b>. So rapid were the flames, 
        that in ten minutes the whole building together with a corn mill 
        adjoining, worked by <b>Mr. J. Pither</b>, was in a complete blaze. </p>

        <p class="stbody">Parties returning from Ascot races arrived at Loddon 
        Bridge just as the flames were observed, and several persons galloped 
        off directly to give assistance; and although the distance from thence 
        was not two miles, on their arrival, they found all efforts useless, for 
        these extensive premises, 70 yards in length and 20 yards in depth, 
        presented nothing but a vast mass of fire. </p>

        <p class="stbody">A messenger was despatched to Reading for the engine, 
        and the Berks and Provincial and Mr. E. S. White’s County went over, and 
        were useful in playing on the burning ruins, but the chief of the 
        property had already been consumed. The tremendous fierceness of the 
        fire may be judged of from massive beams formed from the largest trees 
        having been burned in two and nearly consumed. </p>

        <p class="stbody"><b>Mr. John Pither</b>, whose dwelling house is very 
        near, but luckily protected by a strong wall, on going upstairs, saw the 
        flames through the drying room windows; he instantly ran over to his own 
        mill, but so rapid was the progress of the devouring element, he found 
        it in such a blaze that he could not enter. The drying room was in the 
        centre of the building, and the flames proceeded with equal swiftness to 
        both extremities, which accounts for the corn mill appearing on fire at 
        the same instant, with the paper mill. </p>

        <p class="stbody">We hear there is too much reason to suspect that the 
        fire was occasioned by some diabolical incendiary. <b>Mr. Rogers</b> is 
        insured in the Guardian office for £2,800; and the buildings, which are 
        the property of Major Dawson, for £3,500 in the Berks and Provincial 
        office. </p>

        <p class="stbody"><b>Mr. John Pither</b>, who is a most industrious man, 
        with a wife and large family of young children, we are sorry to find is 
        uninsured; his loss will exceed £400, and we fear it will prove his 
        total ruin, if he is not assisted by the public; we therefore trust that 
        a subscription will be made for his relief from this dire calamity. <b>
        Mr. Jeacocke</b>, of Aborfield, who ground corn at the mill, is also a 
        sufferer in flour to the value of £100.&nbsp; </p>
